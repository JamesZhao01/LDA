It is particularly strong when working with mathematical symbols.\nThe history of LaTeX begins with a program called TEX. In 1978, a computer\nscientist by the name of Donald Knuth grew frustrated with the mistakes that\nhis publishers made in typesetting his work. He decided to create a typesetting\nprogram that everyone could easily use to typeset documents, particularly those\nthat include formulae, and made it freely available. The result is TEX.\nKnuth\u2019s product is an immensely powerful program, but one that does focus\nvery much on small details. A mathematician and computer scientist by the\nname of Leslie Lamport wrote a variant of TEX called LaTeX that focuses on\ndocument structure rather than such details.\n\n1.2\n\nRequired Components of a LaTeX Document\n\nEvery LaTeX document must contain the following three components. Everything else is optional (even text).\n1. \\documentclass{article}\n2. \\begin{document}\n3. \\end{document}\nThe first statement tells LaTeX what kind of document it is to process, as there\nare different style rules for different kinds of documents. We will use the article\ndocument class exclusively in this tutorial. Other possible classes include report,\nbook, and letter.\nThe default font size for each class is 10 point. You can use 11 point or 12\npoint fonts by including this information in the \\documentclass command as\n\\documentclass[11pt]{article} or \\documentclass[12pt]{article}. You\ncould also use \\documentclass[10pt]{article}, but since this is the default\nyou don\u2019t need to type the [10pt] part.\nIn general, required information is included in LaTeX commands in braces {},\nwhile optional information is included in square brackets [].\nThe \\documentclass command must appear at the very beginning of your\nLaTeX document, before any other LaTeX commands, or you will get an error\nmessage.\n\n4\n\n\fIf you have commands for LaTeX that will affect the whole document, you\nshould include them in the preamble, which is what the space between the\n\\documentclass and \\begin{document} commands is called. The body of\nthe document, where you include all of your text, must occur between the\n\\begin{document} and \\end{document} commands. Any text that comes after\nthe \\end{document} command will be ignored.\n\n1.3\n\nUsing LaTeX on Elon\u2019s Computers\n\nLaTeX consists of several programs:\n1. A program latex that processes your input.\n2. A program (yap on our computers) that previews and prints your work.\nIn addition, you need an editor that produces plain text without formatting\ncommands as well as a good spell-checker.\nJim Beuerle has arranged for all of these programs to be installed on Elon\u2019s lab\nPC\u2019s, as well as a program TeXShell to coordinate them.\nYou can start TeXShell either from a desktop seashell icon (for the machines\nin Duke 201, 204, and 209) or from the Start/Courseware/Math menu (for the\nlab machines).\nTo use TexShell, you need to follow the following steps:\n1. You should either create a new LaTeX file with File/New or open an\nexisting LaTeX file with File/Open.\n2. You need to designate the main file that you will be working with, since\nLaTeX files can include other LaTeX files and the programs need to know\nwhich one to use; a number of secondary files will be created with the\nsame filename but different extensions. Use File/Main File.\n3. You should use the main editing screen to enter and revise your work.\n4. Always spell-check or your teachers will laugh and/or cry at your work:\nuse Edit/Spell Check.\n5. Press the TeX button to run the LaTeX program on your file. A small\nwindow will open and close during this time; any error messages will show\nup there; if successful the window will close itself. If not, you will need to\ntype an \u201cx\u201d and hit Enter to close it after reading the error message.\n6. If you want to see the warnings and error messages later, press the Log\nbutton.\n\n5\n\n\f7. To view your masterpiece, press the Preview button. If you are happy\nwith the result, the Preview program has a printer icon at the top left.\n8. If your masterpiece includes graphics, you will probably want to create a\nPDF file for printing and sharing; use the PDFLaTeX button to create a\nPDF file (with a file extension pdf ). Use Acrobat Reader to preview and\nprint it; this program is installed on all Elon PC\u2019s and will start up if you\ndouble click the file\u2019s name in any directory listing.\n\n1.4\n\nError Messages\n\nLaTeX will tell you when it figures out that something is wrong. Often the\nactual error occurs earlier in your file.\nA common error is not to close braces for a command. Another one that occurs\nfrequently is to use math commands outside of math mode (described later).\nSince LaTeX will stop after any \\end{document} command, a good strategy\nfor finding errors is to insert \\end{document} temporarily earlier in the file to\nsee if the error is above its location.\n\n1.5\n\nTyping LaTeX Commands\n\nFor this tutorial, you will occasionally find yourself having to type LaTeX commands as part of your text. How do you do that without LaTeX taking them\nseriously and following them?\nSurround any text that you want printed as is with a \\begin{verbatim} and\nan \\end{verbatim} command.\nPractice: Create a document that explains what some LaTeX commands do.\n\n6\n\n\f2\n\nDocument Structure\n\n2.1\n\nPage Numbering and Headings\n\nThe command \\pagestyle controls page numbering and headings. It should\nalways go between the \\documentclass{article} and the \\begin{document}\ncommands. It can take the following forms:\n1. \\pagestyle{plain} is the default, which puts the page number at the\ncenter of the bottom of the page and provides no headings.\n2. \\pagestyle{empty} provides neither page numbers nor headings.\n3. \\pagestyle{headings} will provide page numbers and headings from any\n\\section\u2019s that you are using.\n4. \\pagestyle{myheadings} will provide page numbers and custom headings.\nThese commands can also be applied to a single page using \\thispagestyle\ninstead of \\pagestyle.\nPractice: Prepare two documents entitled format1.tex and format2.tex containing any text that you want and using the first two different page styles.\n\n2.2\n\nCreating a Title Page\n\nThe title, author, and date of your document are information that various LaTeX\ncommands can make use of, if you provide it. It is a good habit to get into to\nprovide this information in the preamble of your document. (Remember that\nthe preamble refers to any commands between the \\documentclass command\nand the \\begin{document} command.) The commands are:\n1. \\title{yourtitlehere}\n2. \\author{yournamehere}\n3. \\date{currentdate}\nGiven that you have provided this information in the preamble, you may or may\nnot want a title heading. If you do, place a \\maketitle command immediately\nafter the \\begin{document} command.\nPractice: Create a document of three pages with a title heading, using the\n\\pagestyle{plain} command.\n\n7\n\n\f2.3\n\nCreating a Title Page, Continued\n\nThe \\documentclass command can take a titlepage option:\n\\documentclass[titlepage]{article}.\nPractice: Create a document of three pages with a title page, using the\n\\documentclass[titlepage]{article} command.\n\n2.4\n\nSections\n\nLaTeX is a language for creating structured documents. One of the most important ways of creating structure in a document is to split it into logical sections.\nIf your document deals with more than one concept or theme, then each concept\nshould go into its own section.\nThere are two related commands for creating sections: \\section{sectiontitle}\nand \\section*{sectiontitle}. The first one numbers the sections, while the\nstarred form does not. Both create separate sections with titles in a larger font\nsize; they also provide information to LaTeX in case you want to create a Table\nof Contents.\nPractice: Create a document with five numbered sections.\n\n2.5\n\nCross-References\n\nIf you wish to have cross-references in a document with numbered sections, use\n\\label{name} to label the point in your document with some mnemonic, and\nSection \\ref{name} to refer to that point. \\ref{name} will be replaced by\nthe number of the section containing the corresponding \\label command. As\nwith your bibliography citations, you will need to run LaTeX twice to generate\nthese references.\nPractice: Create a fake document with many numbered sections and lots of\ncross references.\n\n2.6\n\nTable of Contents\n\nFor a large document, it is a kindness to your reader to provide a Table of Contents. If you have been using \\section commands throughout your document,\nthen LaTeX has all the information that it needs to construct one for you. Place\nthe command \\tableofcontents after your \\begin{document} command.\nIt may be necessary to run LaTeX twice on a document with a Table of Contents:\nthe first time, LaTeX stores the page numbers for the sections in a separate\nfile, and then the second time LaTeX writes this information into the Table of\n\n8\n\n\fContents. If you have question marks instead of page numbers in your Table of\nContents, run LaTeX again.\nPractice: Create a three page document with at least ten sections and a Table\nof Contents.\n\n2.7\n\nAbstracts\n\nTo create an abstract, place your text in an abstract environment, i.e., between\n\\begin{abstract} and \\end{abstract} commands. The abstract should come\nimmediately after your \\maketitle command, but before any \\tableofcontents\ncommand.\nPractice: Create an abstract, with and without a separate titlepage.\n\n9\n\n\f3\n\nMathematical Typesetting\n\n3.1\n\nMathematical Formulas\n\nThere are two ways to insert mathematical formulas into your document with\nLaTeX. One is to have it appear in a paragraph with text. In doing so, the\nformulas will be compressed vertically: limits for integrals and summations will\nappear to the side instead of on the top and bottom, etc. The other way is to\nhave them appear in a separate paragraph, where there will be more room.\nFor formulas that appear in a paragraph, surround them with $\u2019s. For example,\n$\\alpha$ is the first letter of the Greek alphabet.\nbecomes\n\u03b1 is the first letter of the Greek alphabet.\nTo have formulas appear in their own paragraph, use matching $$\u2019s to surround\nthem. For example,\n$$\n\\frac{x^n-1}{x-1} = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}x^k\n$$\nbecomes\nn\u22121\nxn \u2212 1 X k\n=\nx\nx\u22121\nk=0\n\nPractice: Create your own document with both kinds of formulas.\n\n3.2\n\nGreek Letters\n\n\u2022 \u03b1 is \\alpha\n\u2022 \u03b2 is \\beta\n\u2022 \u03b3 is \\gamma\n\u2022 \u03b4 is \\delta\n\u2022 \u000f is \\epsilon\n\u2022 \u03b5 is \\varepsilon\n\n10\n\n\f\u2022 \u03b6 is \\zeta\n\u2022 \u03b7 is \\eta\n\u2022 \u03b8 is \\theta\n\u2022 \u03d1 is \\vartheta\n\u2022 \u03b9 is \\iota\n\u2022 \u03ba is \\kappa\n\u2022 \u03bb is \\lambda\n\u2022 \u00b5 is \\mu\n\u2022 \u03bd is \\nu\n\u2022 \u03be is \\xi\n\u2022 o is o\n\u2022 \u03c0 is \\pi\n\u2022 $ is \\varpi\n\u2022 \u03c1 is \\rho\n\u2022 % is \\varrho\n\u2022 \u03c3 is \\sigma\n\u2022 \u03c2 is \\varsigma\n\u2022 \u03c4 is \\tau\n\u2022 \u03c5 is \\upsilon\n\u2022 \u03c6 is \\phi\n\u2022 \u03d5 is \\varphi\n\u2022 \u03c7 is \\chi\n\u2022 \u03c8 is \\psi\n\u2022 \u03c9 is \\omega\n\u2022 \u0393 is \\Gamma\n\u2022 \u2206 is \\Delta\n\u2022 \u0398 is \\Theta\n\u2022 \u039b is \\Lambda\n11\n\n\f\u2022 \u039e is \\Xi\n\u2022 \u03a0 is \\Pi\n\u2022 \u03a3 is \\Sigma\n\u2022 \u03a5 is \\Upsilon\n\u2022 \u03a6 is \\Phi\n\u2022 \u03a8 is \\Psi\n\u2022 \u2126 is \\Omega\n\n3.3\n\nExponents and Subscripts\n\nUse the ^ character (shift-6), known as a caret, to create exponents:\n$x^2$\nproduces\nx2\nIf you have an exponent containing more than one character, group the exponent\ncharacters inside braces.\n$x^21 \\ne x^{21}$\nproduces\nx2 1 6= x21\nSimilarly, subscripts are created using the _ (underscore character). Again, for\nsubscripts of more than one character, use braces to indicate where the subscript\nstarts and stops.\n$x_21 \\ne x_{21}$\nproduces\nx2 1 6= x21\nPractice: Create a document containing formulas using exponents and subscripts.\n\n12\n\n\f3.4\n\nAbove and Below\n\nIt is useful to be able to draw horizontal lines and braces above and below parts\nof a formula. We can combine the \\overline, \\overbrace, \\underline, and\n\\underbrace commands to our heart\u2019s content.\n$$\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\nm+n\\\\\nm\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\n= \\frac{(m+n)!}{m!n!}\n= \\frac\n{\\overbrace{(m+n)(m+n-1)\\cdots(n+1)}^\\mbox{$m$ factors}\n{\\underbrace{m(m-1)\\cdots 1}_\\mbox{$m$ factors}}\n$$\nproduces\n\n\u0012\n\nm+n\nm\n\n\u0013\n\nm factors\nz\n}|\n{\n(m + n)(m + n \u2212 1) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (n + 1)\n(m + n)!\n=\n=\nm!n!\nm(m \u2212 1) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 1\n|\n{z\n}\nm factors\n\nwhile\n$\\overline{x+\\overline{y}} = \\overline{x}+y$\nproduces\nx+y =x+y\nPractice: Construct an equation using all four of these commands.\n\n3.5\n\nFractions\n\nFractions can be written in two ways: with a diagonal fraction bar or a horizontal\none. Diagonal fraction bars work best in tight places, such as in a text paragraph\nor when in a larger fraction.\n$a/b$\n\n13\n\n\fbecomes\na/b\nThe horizontal bar is clearer when you have more room, such as in a formula\nparagraph. The command is a little more complicated, because the numerator\nand denominator are often complicated themselves. A horizontal bar fraction is\nwritten as \\frac{numerator}{denominator}.\n$$\n\\frac{a/b-c/d}{e/f-g/h}\n$$\nbecomes\na/b \u2212 c/d\ne/f \u2212 g/h\nPractice: Construct a couple of nested fractions yourself.\n\n3.6\n\nFunctions\n\nLaTeX uses italics in math mode for variables to make them stand out, but\nRoman (non-italic) for function names. How is LaTeX to know the difference\nbetween \u201csin\u201d as function name and \u201csin\u201d as the product of the variables s, i,\nand n? Use a backslash in front of \u201csin\u201d and other function names to let LaTeX\nknow that you want the function, not the product of variables.\nHere is a list of function names:\n\\arccos\n\\coth\n\\hom\n\\ln\n\\sinh\n\n3.7\n\n\\arcsin\n\\csc\n\\inf\n\\log\n\\sup\n\n\\arctan\n\\deg\n\\ker\n\\max\n\\tan\n\n\\arg\n\\det\n\\lg\n\\min\n\\tanh\n\n\\cos\n\\dim\n\\lim\n\\Pr\n\n\\cosh\n\\exp\n\\liminf\n\\sec\n\n\\cot\n\\gcd\n\\limsup\n\\sin\n\nSums, Integrals, and Limits\n\nSummations and integrals both have lower and upper limits, and the commands\nare similar.

As a consequence,\n\u2022 One blank space is the same as a million blank spaces.\n\u2022 Tabs are treated like blank spaces.\n\u2022 Blanks at the end of a line are ignored.\n\u2022 A single \u201cEnter\u201d is treated like a blank space.\n\u2022 More than one \u201cEnter\u201d marks the beginning of a new paragraph.\n\n4.2\n\nFine-Tuning Spacing in Math-Mode\n\nIt is possible to adjust the spacing that LaTeX uses in math mode. (I usually\nadd a little space with \\, before the differential when I write an integral.)\n1. \\, produces a small space\n2. \\: produces a medium space\n3. \\; produces a large space\n4. \\! produces a small negative space\nTry them all out in math mode before continuing.\n\n4.3\n\nDouble Spacing\n\nThere will be times when you will need to submit a draft that is double-spaced,\nto permit a grader or editor to make comments. LaTeX does not explicitly\nsupport doing this, because, well, it looks ugly.\nStill: to double-space a paper, put \\renewcommand{\\baselinestretch}{2} in\nyour paper\u2019s preamble. Give it a try.\n\n4.4\n\nSloppy Line Breaks\n\nLaTeX works very hard to find an optimal line break for each line of your document. It you are not happy with its result, surround the offending paragraph\nwith \\begin{sloppypar} and \\end{sloppypar} commands. Then LaTeX will\nnot break words up but rather will allow more spacing between words in the\ngiven paragraph.\n19\n\n\f4.5\n\nEnlarging Pages\n\nLaTeX works very hard to find the best place to break between pages. If you are\nunhappy with the result, you can change it with the following two commands:\n1. \\newpage will force the start of a new page.\n2. \\enlargethispage{size} will increase the number of lines added to a\npage, where size is a measurement with units, such as 1in or 2cm.\n\n20\n\n\f5\n\nAccents and Font Style\n\n5.1\n\nAccents\n\nLaTeX can produce the following accents. (The letter \u201cu\u201d is only used for the\npurposes of this example. The accents work with any letter.)\nu\u0300\nu\u0308\nu\u030c\nu.\n\nis\nis\nis\nis\n\nu\u0301 is \\\u2019{u}\nu\u0302 is \\^{u}\nu\u0303 is \\~{u}\nu\u0304 is \\={u}\nu\u0307 is \\.{u}\nu\u0306 is \\u{u}\nu\u030b is \\H{u} u\n\u007f u is \\t{uu} u\u0327 is \\c{u}\nu is \\b{u}\nu\u030a is \\r{u}\n\u00af\nPractice: Try typing some of these accents yourself before proceeding.\n\n5.2\n\n\\\u2018{u}\n\\\"{u}\n\\v{u}\n\\d{u}\n\nHyphenation\n\nThere are four different variations on hyphens in LaTeX : -, --, ---, and $-$.\n1. - (a single dash) is for hyphenating words.\n2. -- (two dashes) is for ranges of numbers.\n3. --- (three dashes) is for an honest-to-goodness dash between words.\n4. $-$ is a minus sign in math mode.\nMy cousin-in-law lived in Germany in 1995--6;\nhe speaks French---really, he does. His favorite number is $-2$.\nproduces\nMy cousin-in-law lived in Germany in 1995\u20136.\nHe speaks French\u2014really, he does.\nHis favorite number is \u22122.\nNotice the difference in appearance of the four variations.\nPractice: Try using all of them yourself before continuing.\n\n5.3\n\nThe LATEX Logo\n\nYou can typeset the LATEX logo with the \\LaTeX command. As with most\ncommands, it consumes any space behind it, so if it isn\u2019t at the end of a sentence,\nuse \\LaTeX\\ instead.\nPractice: Try using the logo.\n21\n\n\f5.4\n\nQuotation Marks\n\nBeginning and ending quotation marks differ. In LaTeX, use \u2018\u2018 (usually on the\nleft side of the keyboard) to begin a quotation and \u2019\u2019 (usually on the right side\nof the keyboard) to end a quotation:\nShe said \u2018\u2018three\u2019\u2019.\nproduces\nShe said \u201cthree\u201d.\nPractice: Try using quotation marks before going on.\n\n5.5\n\nChanging the Appearance of Words\n\nThere are many ways of changing the appearance of words to add emphasis,\nsuch as underlining, boldfacing, and italicizing. When over-used, these changes\ncan make a document hard to read, so they should always be used sparingly.\nLaTeX provides underlining, boldfacing, and italicizing, but studies have shown\nthat italicizing is most effecting in stressing without distracting.\nUse\n\\underline{phrase}\nto underline a phrase,\n\\textbf{phrase}\nto print a phrase in boldface, and\n\\emph{phrase}\nto italicize a phrase.\nPractice: Try all three methods out now.\n\n22\n\n\f6\n6.1\n\nTables, Arrays, and Lists\nConstructing Arrays\n\nTo construct an array, surround the entries with a \\begin{array}{justification}\ncommand and an \\end{array} command. The justification should consist of\nl for left justification, c for centered justification, or r for right justification.\nSeparate column entries by an &, and end each line with a \\\\. If your array is\na matrix, you can surround it with large parentheses \\left( and \\right). For\nexample:\n$$\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n\\alpha&\\beta&\\gamma\\\\\n\\delta&\\epsilon&\\zeta\\\\\n\\eta&\\theta&\\iota\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\n$$\nproduces\n\uf8eb\n\n\u03b1\n\uf8ed \u03b4\n\u03b7\n\n\u03b2\n\u000f\n\u03b8\n\n\uf8f6\n\u03b3\n\u03b6 \uf8f8\n\u03b9\n\nPractice: Create your own document with an array with a mix of left, center,\nand right-justified columns.\n\n6.2\n\nConstructing Tables\n\nTo construct a table, surround the entries with a \\begin{tabular}{justification}\ncommand and an \\end{tabular} command. The justification should consist\nof l for left justification, c for centered justification, or r for right justification.\nSeparate column entries by a &, and end each line with a \\\\. Use \\hline to\nconstruct a horizontal line, and separate the l, c, and r \u2019s by a | wherever you\nwant a vertical line. For example:\n\\begin{tabular}{|r|c|l|}\n\\hline\nRight & Center & Left\\\\\n\\hline\n\n23\n\n\falpha&beta&gamma\\\\\ndelta&epsilon&zeta\\\\\neta&theta&iota\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\nproduces\nRight\nalpha\ndelta\neta\n\nCenter\nbeta\nepsilon\ntheta\n\nLeft\ngamma\nzeta\niota\n\nPractice: Create your own document with a table with a mix of left, center,\nand right-justified columns.\n\n24\n\n\f7\n\nMultiline Equations\n\n7.1\n\nMulti-line Equations\n\nOften, in a derivation, you will want to have a series of equations or inequalities aligned together. Surround the equations by \\begin{eqnarray*} and\n\\end{eqnarray*}. (The same command without the asterisk generates equation numbers automatically.) Surround the equals sign or inequality with &\u2019s,\nand end each line with \\\\. Note: you do not need to use $$\u2019s with this environment. For example,\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\n1+2+\\ldots+n &=& \\frac{1}{2}((1+2+\\ldots+n)+(n+\\ldots+2+1))\\\\\n&=& \\frac{1}{2}\\underbrace{(n+1)+(n+1)+\\ldots+(n+1)}_{\\mbox{$n$ copies}}\\\\\n&=& \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\\\\n\\end{eqnarray*}\nproduces\n\n1 + 2 + ... + n\n\n=\n=\n\n=\n\n1\n((1 + 2 + . . . + n) + (n + . . . + 2 + 1))\n2\n1\n(n + 1) + (n + 1) + . . . + (n + 1)\n{z\n}\n2|\nn copies\nn(n + 1)\n2\n\nPractice: Produce your own aligned set of 5 equations.\n\n7.2\n\nAccents\n\nWe use several different kinds of accents in mathematics: a hat, bar, dot, and\narrow over a variable all have different meanings. LaTeX uses commands that\nsurround the variable:\n$\\hat{a}, \\dot{a}, \\ddot{a}, \\tilde{a}, \\bar{a}, \\vec{a}$\nyields\na\u0302, a\u0307, a\u0308, a\u0303, a\u0304, ~a\nPractice: Try each of these commands out before continuing.\n25\n\n\f7.3\n\nBracket Symbols\n\nBrackets, such as braces and parentheses, are used to group expressions. Without them it would be a good deal more difficult to understand complicated\nmathematical expressions.\nWhen working with complicated expressions, it is important for the brackets to\nexpand to match the size of whatever they contain. In LaTeX, the way to do\nthat is with matching \\left( and \\right) commands. (You can use |, {, }, [,\nand ] instead of parentheses. Remember that since braces are used to group in\nLaTeX, we have to use \\{ and \\}.) Since every \\left needs a matching \\right,\nit is important to have null commands \\left. and \\right. which do nothing.\nHere are some examples:\n$$\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n1&2\\\\\n3&4\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\n$$\nproduces\n\u0012\n\n1\n3\n\n\u001a\n\n\u2212x x \u2264 0\nx\nx\u22650\n\n2\n4\n\n\u0013\n\nwhile\n$$\n|x| =\n\\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{lr}\n-x&x\\le 0\\\\\nx&x\\ge 0\n\\end{array}\n\\right.\n$$\nproduces\n|x| =\n\n26\n\n\fPractice: Construct a document containing the following expression:\nlim\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n7.4\n\n\u0010\n\n1+\n\nx \u0011n\n= ex\nn\n\nDots\n\nThe continuation dots ... are known as an ellipsis. They occur frequently\nenough in mathematics for LaTeX to have four commands to typeset them\nwith the right spacing. They are\n1. \\cdots for center height dots.\n2. \\ddots for diagonal dots, which occur in matrices.\n3. \\ldots for lower height dots.\n4. \\vdots for vertical dots.\n$a_1,\\ldots, a_n$\nproduces\na1 , . . . , an\n$$\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{ccc}\na_{11}&\\cdots&a_{1n}\\\\\n\\vdots&\\ddots&\\vdots\\\\\na_{m1}&\\cdots&a_{mn}\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\n$$\nproduces\n\uf8eb\n\na11\n\uf8ec ..\n\uf8ed .\nam1\n\n\uf8f6\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 a1n\n.. \uf8f7\n..\n.\n. \uf8f8\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 amn\n\nPractice: Construct a document using at least two different forms of dots.\n\n27\n\n\f7.5\n\nIndenting\n\nThe default for a LaTeX document is to indent new paragraphs unless the\nparagraph follows a section heading. If you want to change the indentation, use\nthe \\indent and \\noindent commands respectively, at the beginning of the\nparagraph in question.\nIf you wish to choose the amount of indentation for some reason, then use the\ncommand \\setlength{\\parindent}{size of indentation with unit}. (I\nonly do this to set the indentation to 0in when I want no indentation in my documentation.) Since this is a command that affects the whole document, it should\ngo in the preamble, between the \\documentclass and \\begin{document} commands.\n\n28\n\n\f8\n8.1\n\nText Formatting\nCentering Text\n\nBy default, LaTeX will start all text at the left margin. If you want to center\na title, a table, etc., surround what you want centered with the commands\n\\begin{center} and \\end{center}.\nPractice: Create a document containing text that is and isn\u2019t centered.\n\n8.2\n\nSpecial Headers\n\nA header is the text automatically included at the top of each document. If you\nuse \\pagestyle{myheadings}, then you will need some way to indicate what\nyour heading is. The command \\markright{Your Header Text Here} will do\nthe job for you.\nThe name of the command \\markright requires a little explanation. An option\nthat we will not use in this tutorial is \\documentclass[twoside]{article},\nwhich produces pages formatted as in a book, i.e., with a left page and a right\npage. Using this option it is possible to produce different headings for the\nleft and right pages. When using the default of one-sided pages, all pages are\nthought of as right pages, and we use \\markright to mark our headings on\nthese right-sided pages.\nPractice: Produce a three-page document with the name of this course as your\nheading.\n\n8.3\n\nExtended Quotation\n\nIf you are going to include an extended quotation from another source, it is\nimportant to indicate the difference between the quotation and your words. The\nleast obtrusive way to do so is to indent. In LaTeX, surround the quotation with\n\\begin{quote} and \\end{quote}.\nPractice: Create a document containing regular text and containing a quotation\nof several paragraphs.\n\n8.4\n\nBulleted Lists\n\nTo create a bulleted list, surround the information with a \\begin{itemize}\nand an \\end{itemize}, and begin each item with an \\item.\nFor example,\n\n29\n\n\f\\begin{itemize}\n\\item A bulleted item.\n\\item Another bulleted item.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item A nested bulleted item.\n\\end{itemize}\n\\item You get the idea.\n\\end{itemize}\nproduces\n\u2022 A bulleted item.\n\u2022 Another bulleted item.\n\u2013 A nested bulleted item.\n\u2022 You get the idea.\nPractice: Create a document creating your own bulleted list. Have one of the\nitems in your list itself consist of a bulleted list.\n\n8.5\n\nNumbered Lists\n\nTo create a numbered list, surround the information with a \\begin{enumerate}\nand an \\end{enumerate}, and begin each item with an \\item.\nFor example,\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item A numbered item.\n\\item Another numbered item.\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item A nested numbered item.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\\item You get the idea.\n\\end{enumerate}\nproduces\n1. A numbered item.\n2. Another numbered item.\n(a) A nested numbered item.\n3. You get the idea.\nPractice: Create a document creating your own numbered list. Have one of the\nitems in your list itself consist of a numbered list.\n30\n\n\f8.6\n\nFilling a Line\n\nYou can insert an arbitrary amount of space into a line with the \\hspace{length}\ncommand. Here the length must include a unit, such as 1.5in or 2.3cm.\nIf you want a spacing in a line that will push the surrounding words to the left\nand right margins, use the \\hfill command. If instead of spacing, you want\neither dots or a line, use \\dotfill or \\hrulefill, respectively.\nPractice: Try all of these commands out now.\n\n8.7\n\nLine Breaks\n\nLaTeX works very hard to find optimal places to split lines of text in making\nparagraphs. You can help it by indicating when it should avoid a line break.\nUse a ~ for a space that should not be used to break a line.\nWhen shouldn\u2019t you break a line?\n1. Don\u2019t break a line between a title such as Mr., Ms., Dr., etc., and the\nname that follows it.\n2. Don\u2019t break a line between a number and the units that follow it.\n3. Don\u2019t break a line between the words in a name.\nLaTeX inserts more space at the end of a sentence then between its words. If\nyou use an abbreviation like Dr. in the middle of a sentence, then you need to\nlet LaTeX know that the period is not the end of a sentence, with a ~ (if the\nline should not be broken there) or a \\ followed by a space (if the line could be\nbroken there).\nIf you need to force a line to break at a given point, use \\\\.\n\n31\n\n\f9\n9.1\n\nBibliography and Compound Expressions\nBibliographies\n\nFor large documents requiring a good deal of revision, it can be difficult to coordinate references in the body of the document with the bibliography at its end.\nLaTeX provides a mechanism for automatically linking citations with items in\nthe bibliography. Surround the bibliography with \\begin{thebibliography}{9}\nand \\end{thebibliography}. For each entry in the bibliography, start with\n\\bibitem{label}, where label is some mnemonic for the reference.\nWith the bibliography in place, a citation in the body of the document is made\nwith \\cite{label}, where label is the same as what occurs in the corresponding\n\\bibitem{label}.\nIn order to keep track of new references that have been added, you will often\nneed to run LaTeX twice before previewing when using \\cite.\nWhat is the 9 in \\begin{thebibliography}{9} for? It is a dummy number indicating how many digits to leave space for in the numbering of the bibliography.\nIf you have 10-99 references, use \\begin{thebibliography}{99} instead.\nPractice: Create a document with a bibliography of five fake works, and cite\neach one at least once in your document.\n\n32\n\n\f10\n10.1\n\nSlides\nThe Slide Class\n\nLaTeX does not want to be Microsoft PowerPoint. On the other hand, if you\nhave mathematical formulae to display on transparencies, LaTeX is there to\nhelp with the slides document class.\nThe slide class uses a larger font that is designed to be legible at a distance.\n\n10.2\n\nHow to Use the Slides Class\n\nThe slides class is easy to use.\n1. Start with \\documentclass{slides}.\n2. Surround the document with \\begin{document} and \\end{document}\ncommands.\n3. Surround the text that you want to appear on each slide with \\begin{slide}\nand \\end{slide} commands.\n4. Preview the slides to see where best to break the material between slides.\n\n33\n\n\f11\n\nIncluding Graphics in Your Document\n\n11.1\n\nGraphic File Formats\n\nThere are a number of graphics formats out there, such as:\n1. bmp\n2. eps\n3. gif\n4. jpg\n5. pdf\n6. ps\nLaTeX works best with the postscript formats (eps, ps) which were around\nwhen the program was first created. For the other formats, LaTeX may or may\nnot work; you would be safer trying PDFLaTeX, which will produce a PDF\ndocument.\n\n11.2\n\nGraphics Package\n\nIf you are going to include graphics in your document, you will need to ask\nLaTeX to use a package of graphics commands: place \\usepackage{graphicx}\nin the preamble.\n\n11.3\n\nIncluding Graphics Within Your Document\n\nYou use the \\includegraphics{graphicfile} command to include your graphic\nfile in your document.\nIf you wish to control the size of the document, you can also specify the height\nand width: \\includegraphics[height=2in, width = 3in]{graphicfile}.\n\n34\n\n\f12\n12.1\n\nBusiness Letters\nThe Letter Class\n\nAside from the article class, LaTeX provides a letter class for formal letters. A\ngiven file can be use to generate several letters simultaneously. To use the letter\nclass,\n1. Start with a \\documentclass{letter}.\n2. Include the commands that apply to all letters in the file.\n3. Begin with a \\begin{document} command.\n4. Include the commands for each letter.\n5. End with a \\end{document} command.\n\n12.2\n\nLetter Commands for the Preamble\n\nThe following commands apply to each letter in the file:\n1. \\address{youraddress} for your return address.\n2. \\signature{yournameandtitle} for your printed name in the signature\nblock.\n3. \\date{letterdate} if you want to fix the date on the letter; otherwise\nthe date will default to the current date when the letter is printed.\n\n12.3\n\nCommands for Each Letter\n\n1. Start with \\begin{letter}.\n2. On the next line, type the addressee\u2019s address in braces. Separate lines\nwith \\\\\u2019s.\n3. Put your opening greeting in \\opening{dearjohndoe}.\n4.

The Workbook Window\nIn Excel 2013, when you open up a new workbook it now contains only 1 worksheet There can be a max\nof 1,048,576 rows and 16,384 columns in an excel work sheet.\n\uf071 The Worksheet\nExcel files are called workbooks. Each workbook holds one or more worksheets (also known as\n\"spreadsheets\").\nWhenever you create a new Excel workbook, it will contain one worksheet named Sheet1. A worksheet is\na grid of columns and rows where columns are designated by letters running across the top of the\nworksheet and rows are designated by numbers running down the left side of the worksheet.\n\nWhen working with a large amount of data, you can create multiple worksheets to help organize your\nworkbook and make it easier to find content. You can also group worksheets to quickly add information\nto multiple worksheets at the same time.\nTo rename a worksheet\nWhenever you create a new Excel workbook, it will contain one worksheet named Sheet1. You can rename\na worksheet to better reflect its content. In our example, we will create a training log organized by month.\n1.

Whenever you start a new project in Excel, you'll need to create a new\nworkbook. There are several ways to start working with a workbook in Excel 2013. You can choose to\ncreate a new workbook\u2014either with a blank workbook or a predesigned template\u2014or open an existing\nworkbook.\n2.2.1. Create a new blank workbook\n1. Select the File tab. Backstage view will appear.\n\nPage | 22\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\n2. Select New, then click Blank workbook.\n3. A new blank workbook will appear.\n2.2.2. Open an existing workbook\nIn addition to creating new workbooks, you'll often need to open a workbook that was previously saved.\n1. Navigate to Backstage view, then click Open.\n\n2. Select Computer, and then click Browse.\n\nPage | 23\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\n3. The Open dialog box will appear. Locate and select your workbook, then click Open.\n\n\uf021 TIP: If you've opened the desired workbook recently, you can browse your Recent Workbooks\nrather than searching for the file.\n\nPage | 24\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\nTo pin a workbook\nIf you frequently work with the same workbook, you can pin it to Backstage view for quick access.\n1. Navigate to Backstage view and then click Open. Your recently edited workbooks will appear.\n2. Hover the mouse over the workbook you wish to pin. A pushpin icon\nworkbook. Click the pushpin icon.\n\nwill appear next to the\n\n3. The workbook will stay in Recent Workbooks. To unpin a workbook, simply click the pushpin icon\nagain.\n\uf021 TIP: You can also pin folders to Backstage view for quick access. From Backstage view, click Open,\nthen locate the folder you wish to pin and click the pushpin icon.\n\n2.2.3. Compatibility mode\nSometimes you may need to work with workbooks that were created in earlier versions of Microsoft Excel,\nsuch as Excel 2003 or Excel 2000. When you open these kinds of workbooks, they will appear in\nCompatibility mode.\n\nPage | 25\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\nCompatibility mode disables certain features, so you'll only be able to access commands found in the\nprogram that was used to create the workbook. For example, if you open a workbook created in Excel\n2003, you can only use tabs and commands found in Excel 2003.\nIn order to exit Compatibility mode, you'll need to convert the workbook to the current version type.\nHowever, if you're collaborating with others who only have access to an earlier version of Excel, it's best\nto leave the workbook in Compatibility mode so the format will not change.\nTo convert a workbook\nIf you want access to all of the Excel 2013 features, you can convert the workbook to the 2013 file format.\nNote that converting a file may cause some changes to the original layout of the workbook.\n1. Click the File tab to access Backstage view.\n2. Locate and select Convert command.\n\n3. The Save As dialog box will appear. Select the location where you wish to save the workbook,\nenter a file name for the presentation, and click Save.\n4. The workbook will be converted to the newest file type.\n\nChallenge!\n1. Create a new blank workbook.\n2. Open an existing workbook from your computer.\n3. Pin a folder to Backstage view.\n\nPage | 26\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\n2.3.\n\nSaving and Sharing Workbooks\n\nWhenever you create a new workbook in Excel, you'll need to know how to save it in order to access and\nedit it later. As with previous versions of Excel, you can save files locally to your computer. But unlike older\nversions, Excel 2013 also lets you save a workbook to the cloud using OneDrive. You can also export and\nshare workbooks with others directly from Excel.\n2.3.1. Save and Save As\nExcel offers two ways to save a file: Save and Save As. These options work in similar ways, with a few\nimportant differences:\n\uf0fe Save: When you create or edit a workbook, you'll use the Save command to save your changes.\nYou'll use this command most of the time. When you save a file, you'll only need to choose a file\nname and location the first time. After that, you can just click the Save command to save it with\nthe same name and location.\n\uf0fe Save As: You'll use this command to create a copy of a workbook while keeping the original. When\nyou use Save As, you'll need to choose a different name and/or location for the copied version.\nTo save a workbook\nIt's important to save your workbook whenever you start a new project or make changes to an existing\none. Saving early and often can prevent your work from being lost. You'll also need to pay close attention\nto where you save the workbook so it will be easy to find later.\n1. Locate and select the Save command on the Quick Access Toolbar.\n\n2. If you're saving the file for the first time, the Save As pane will appear in Backstage view.\n3. You'll then need to choose where to save the file and give it a file name. To save the workbook to\nyour computer, select Computer, then click Browse. Alternatively, you can click OneDrive to save\nthe file to your OneDrive.\n4. The Save As dialog box will appear. Select the location where you wish to save the workbook.\n\nPage | 27\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\n5. Enter a file name for the workbook, then click Save.\n\nChoose a location, and\nthen type the file name.\n\n6. The workbook will be saved. You can click the Save command again to save your changes as you\nmodify the workbook.\nUsing Save As to make a copy\nIf you want to save a different version of a workbook while keeping the original, you can create a copy.\nFor example, if you have a file named \"Sales Data\" you could save it as \"Sales Data 2\" so you'll be able to\nedit the new file and still refer back to the original version.\nTo do this, you'll click the Save As command in Backstage view. Just like when saving a file for the first\ntime, you'll need to choose where to save the file and give it a new file name.\n2.3.2. AutoRecover\nExcel automatically saves your workbooks to a temporary folder while you are working on them. If you\nforget to save your changes, or if Excel crashes, you can restore the file using AutoRecover.\nTo use AutoRecover\n1. Open Excel 2013. If auto-saved versions of a file are found, the Document Recovery pane will\nappear.\n\nPage | 28\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\n2. Click to open an available file. The workbook will be recovered.\n\n\uf021 TIP: By default, Excel autosaves every 10 minutes. If you are editing a workbook for less than 10\nminutes, Excel may not create an autosaved version.\nIf you don't see the file you need, you can browse all autosaved files from Backstage view. Just select the\nFile tab, click Manage Versions, and then choose Recover Unsaved Workbooks.\n\n2.3.3. Exporting workbooks\nBy default, Excel workbooks are saved in the .xlsx file type. However, there may be times when you need\nto use another file type, such as a PDF or Excel 97-2003 workbook. It's easy to export your workbook from\nExcel in a variety of file types.\nTo export a workbook as a PDF file\nExporting your workbook as an Adobe Acrobat document, commonly known as a PDF file, can be especially\nuseful if sharing a workbook with someone who does not have Excel. A PDF will make it possible for\nrecipients to view, but not edit, the content of your workbook.\n1. Click the File tab to access Backstage view.\n2. Click Export, then select Create PDF/XPS.\n\nPage | 29\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\n3. The Save As dialog box will appear. Select the location where you wish to export the workbook,\nenter a file name, and then click Publish.\n\uf021 TIP: By default, Excel will only export the active worksheet. If you have multiple worksheets and\nwant to save all of them in the same PDF file, click Options in the Save as dialog box. The Options\ndialog box will appear. Select Entire workbook, then click OK.\n\nTo export a workbook in other file types\nYou may also find it helpful to export your workbook in other file types, such as an Excel 97-2003 Workbook\nif you need to share with people using an older version of Excel, or a .CSV file if you need a plain-text\nversion of your workbook.\n\nPage | 30\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\n1. Click the File tab to access Backstage view.\n2. Click Export, then select Change File Type.\n3. Select a common file type, then click Save As.\n4. The Save As dialog box will appear. Select the location where you wish to export the workbook,\nenter a file name, and then click Save.\n\nChallenge!\n5. Create a new blank workbook.\n6. Use the Save command to save the workbook to your desktop.\n7. Save the workbook to OneDrive and invite someone else to view it.\n8. Export the workbook as a PDF file.\n\n3. Cell Basics\nWhenever you work with Excel, you'll enter information, or content, into cells. Cells are the basic building\nblocks of a worksheet. You'll need to learn the basics of cells and cell content to calculate, analyze, and\norganize data in Excel.\n\n3.1.\n\nUnderstanding Cells\n\nEvery worksheet is made up of thousands of rectangles, which are called cells. A cell is the intersection of\na row and a column. Columns are identified by letters (A, B, C), while rows are identified by numbers (1, 2,\n3).\nColum\nn\nCell\n\nRow\n\nPage | 31\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\nEach cell has its own name, or cell address, based on its column and row. In this example, the selected cell\nintersects column C and row 5, so the cell address is C5. The cell address will also appear in the Name box.\nNote that a cell's column and row headings are highlighted when the cell is selected.\nCell Address\n\nYou can also select multiple cells at the same time. A group of cells is known as a cell range. Rather than a\nsingle cell address, you will refer to a cell range using the cell addresses of the first and last cells in the cell\nrange, separated by a colon. For example, a cell range that included cells A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5 would be\nwritten as A1:A5.\nIn the images below, two different cell ranges are selected:\n\uf0b7\n\nCell range A1:A8\n\n\uf0b7\n\nCell range A1:B8\n\nPage | 32\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\nTo select a cell range\nSometimes you may want to select a larger group of cells, or a cell range.\n1. Click, hold, and drag the mouse until all of the adjoining cells you wish to select are highlighted.\n2. Release the mouse to select the desired cell range. The cells will remain selected until you click\nanother cell in the worksheet.\n3.2.\n\nCell Content\n\nAny information you enter into a spreadsheet will be stored in a cell. Each cell can contain several different\nkinds of content, including text, formatting, formulas, and functions.\n\uf071 Text\nCells can contain text, such as letters, numbers, and dates.\n\nPage | 33\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\n\uf071 Formatting Attributes\nCells can contain formatting attributes that change the way letters, numbers, and dates are displayed. For\nexample, percentages can appear as 0.15 or 15%. You can even change a cell's background color.\n\uf071 Formulas and Functions\nCells can contain formulas and functions that calculate cell values. In our example, SUM(B4:B7) adds the\nvalue of each cell in cell range B4:B7 and displays the total in cell B8.\n\nTo insert content\n1. Click a cell to select it.\n\n2. Type content into the selected cell, then press Enter on your keyboard. The content will appear\nin the cell and the formula bar. You can also input and edit cell content in the formula bar.\n\nContent appears in cell\nand formula bar\n\nPage | 34\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\nTo delete cell content\n1. Select the cell with content you wish to delete.\n2. Press the Delete or Backspace key on your keyboard. The cell's contents will be deleted.\nTo delete cells\nThere is an important difference between deleting the content of a cell and deleting the cell itself. If you\ndelete the entire cell, the cells below it will shift up and replace the deleted cells.\n1. Select the cell(s) you wish to delete.\n2. Select the Delete command from the Home tab on the Ribbon.\n3. The cells below will shift up.\n\nTo copy and paste cell content\nExcel allows you to copy content that is already entered into your spreadsheet and paste that content to\nother cells, which can save you time and effort.\n1. Select the cell(s) you wish to copy.\n2. Click the Copy command on the Home tab, or press Ctrl+C on your keyboard.\n\nPage | 35\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\n3. Select the cell(s) where you wish to paste the content. The copied cells will now have a dashed\nbox around them.\n4. Click the Paste command on the Home tab, or press Ctrl+V on your keyboard.\n5. The content will be pasted into the selected cells.\n\nTo access more paste options\nYou can also access additional paste options, which are especially convenient when working with cells that\ncontain formulas or formatting.\n\uf0fe\n\nTo access more paste options, click the drop-down arrow on the Paste command.\n\nPage | 36\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\n\uf021 TIP: Rather than choosing commands from the Ribbon, you can access commands quickly by rightclicking. Simply select the cell(s) you wish to format, then right-click the mouse. A drop-down menu\nwill appear, where you'll find several commands that are also located on the Ribbon.\n\nTo drag and drop cells\nRather than cutting, copying, and pasting, you can drag and drop cells to move their contents.\n1. Select the cell(s) you wish to move.\n2. Hover the mouse over the border of the selected cell(s) until the cursor changes from a white\ncross to a black cross with four arrows.\n3. Click, hold, and drag the cells to the desired location.\n4. Release the mouse, and the cells will be dropped in the selected location.\n\nTo use the fill handle\nThere may be times when you need to copy the content of one cell to several other cells in your\nworksheet. You could copy and paste the content into each cell, but this method would be very time\nconsuming. Instead, you can use the fill handle to quickly copy and paste content to adjacent cells in the\nsame row or column.\n1. Select the cell(s) containing the content you wish to use. The fill handle will appear as a small\nsquare in the bottom-right corner of the selected cell(s).\n\nPage | 37\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\nThe fill handle\n\n2. Click, hold, and drag the fill handle until all of the cells you wish to fill are selected.\n\n3. Release the mouse to fill the selected cells.\nTo continue a series with the fill handle\nThe fill handle can also be used to continue a series. Whenever the content of a row or column follows a\nsequential order, like numbers (1, 2, 3) or days (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday), the fill handle can guess\nwhat should come next in the series. In many cases, you may need to select multiple cells before using\nthe fill handle to help Excel determine the series order. In our example below, the fill handle is used to\nextend a series of dates in a column.\n\nPage | 38\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\n3.3.\n\nFind and Replace\n\nWhen working with a lot of data in Excel, it can be difficult and time consuming to locate specific\ninformation. You can easily search your workbook using the Find feature, which also allows you to modify\ncontent using the Replace feature.\nTo find content\n1. From the Home tab, click the Find and Select command, then select Find... from the drop-down\nmenu.\n\n2. The Find and Replace dialog box will appear. Enter the content you wish to find.\n3.

Delete a cell, and note how the cells below shift up to fill in its place.\n5. Cut cells and paste them into a different location.\n6. Try dragging and dropping some cells to other parts of the worksheet.\n7. Use the fill handle to fill in data to adjoining cells both vertically and horizontally.\n8. Use the Find feature to locate content in your workbook.\n\n4. Formatting Cells\nAll cell content uses the same formatting by default, which can make it difficult to read a workbook with\na lot of information. Basic formatting can customize the look and feel of your workbook, allowing you to\ndraw attention to specific sections and making your content easier to view and understand. You can also\napply number formatting to tell Excel exactly what type of data you\u2019re using in the workbook, such as\npercentages (%), currency ($), and so on.\n\nPage | 41\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\n4.1.\n\nFont Formatting\n\nTo change the font\nBy default, the font of each new workbook is set to Calibri. However, Excel provides a variety of other\nfonts you can use to customize your cell text. In the example below, we'll format our title cell to help\ndistinguish it from the rest of the worksheet.\n1. Select the cell(s) you wish to modify.\n2. Click the drop-down arrow next to the Font command on the Home tab. The Font drop-down\nmenu will appear.\n3. Select the desired font.

Modifying Columns, Rows and Cells\nBy default, every row and column of a new workbook is always set to the same height and width. Excel\nallows you to modify column width and row height in different ways, including wrapping text and merging\ncells.\n\nTo modify column width\n1. Position the mouse over the column line in the column heading so the white cross\ndouble arrow\n.\n\nbecomes a\n\n2. Click, hold, and drag the mouse to increase or decrease the column width.\n3. Release the mouse. The column width will be changed.\n\uf021 TIP: If you see pound signs (#######) in a cell, it means that the column is not wide enough to\ndisplay the cell content. Simply increase the column width to show the cell content.\n\nTo AutoFit column width\nThe AutoFit feature will allow you to set a column's width to fit its content automatically.\n1. Position the mouse over the column line in the column heading so the white cross\ndouble arrow\n\nbecomes a\n\n.\n\n2. Double-click the mouse. The column width will be changed automatically to fit the content.\n\uf021 TIP: You can also AutoFit the width for several columns at the same time. Simply select the columns\nyou would like to AutoFit, then select the AutoFit Column Width command from the Format dropdown menu on the Home tab. This method can also be used for Row height.\n\nPage | 49\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\nTo modify row height\n1. Position the cursor over the row line so the white cross\n\nbecomes a double arrow\n\n.\n\n2. Click, hold, and drag the mouse to increase or decrease the row height.\n3. Release the mouse. The height of the selected row will be changed.\n\nTo modify all rows or columns\nRather than resizing rows and columns individually, you can modify the height and width of every row and\ncolumn at the same time. This method allows you to set a uniform size for every row and column in your\nworksheet.\n1. Locate and click the Select All button\nworksheet.\n\njust below the formula bar to select every cell in the\n\n2. Position the mouse over a row line so the white cross\n\nbecomes a double arrow\n\n.\n\n3. Click, hold, and drag the mouse to increase or decrease the row height.\n4. Release the mouse when you are satisfied with the new row height for the worksheet.\n\nPage | 50\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\n5.1.\n\nInserting, deleting, moving, and hiding rows and columns\n\nAfter you've been working with a workbook for a while, you may find that you want to insert new columns\nor rows, delete certain rows or columns, move them to a different location in the worksheet, or even hide\nthem.\nTo insert rows\n1. Select the row heading below where you want the new row to appear.\n2. Click the Insert command on the Home tab.\n\n3. The new row will appear above the selected row.\n\uf021 TIP: When inserting new rows, columns, or cells, you will see the Insert Options button next to\nthe inserted cells. This button allows you to choose how Excel formats these cells. By default, Excel\nformats inserted rows with the same formatting as the cells in the row above. To access more\noptions, hover your mouse over the Insert Options button, then click the drop-down arrow.\n\nPage | 51\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\nTo insert columns\n1. Select the column heading to the right of where you want the new column to appear.\n2. Click the Insert command on the Home tab.\n\n3. The new column will appear to the left of the selected column.\n\uf021 TIP: When inserting rows and columns, make sure you select the entire row or column by clicking\nthe heading. If you select only a cell in the row or column, the Insert command will only insert a\nnew cell.\nTo delete rows\nIt's easy to delete any row that you no longer need in your workbook.\n1. Select the row(s) you want to delete.\n2. Click the Delete command on the Home tab.\n\nPage | 52\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\n3. The selected row(s) will be deleted, and the rows below will shift up.\nTo delete columns\n1. Select the columns(s) you want to delete.\n2. Click the Delete command on the Home tab.\n\n3. The selected columns(s) will be deleted, and the columns to the right will shift left.\n\uf021 TIP: It's important to understand the difference between deleting a row or column and simply\nclearing its contents. If you want to remove the content of a row or column without causing others\nto shift, right-click a heading, then select Clear Contents from the drop-down menu.\n\nPage | 53\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\nTo move a row or column\nSometimes you may want to move a column or row to rearrange the content of your worksheet.\n1. Select the desired column heading for the column you wish to move, then click the Cut command\non the Home tab or press Ctrl+X on your keyboard.\n2. Select the column heading to the right of where you want to move the column. For example, if you\nwant to move a column between columns B and C, select column C.\n3. Click the Insert command on the Home tab, then select Insert Cut Cells from the drop-down menu.\n\n4. The column will be moved to the selected location, and the columns to the right will shift right.\n\uf021 TIP: You can also access the Cut and Insert commands by right-clicking the mouse and then\nselecting the desired commands from the drop-down menu.\n\nTo hide and unhide a row or column\nAt times, you may want to compare certain rows or columns without changing the organization of your\nworksheet. Excel allows you to hide rows and columns as needed.\n1. Select the column(s) you wish to hide, right-click the mouse, then select Hide from the formatting\nmenu.\n\nPage | 54\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\n2. The columns will be hidden.

Formulas and Functions\nOne of the most powerful features in Excel is the ability to calculate numerical information using formulas.\n\n6.1.\n\nSimple Formulas\n\nJust like a calculator, Excel can add, subtract, multiply, and divide. In this lesson, we'll show you how to\nuse cell references to create simple formulas.\nMathematical operators\nExcel uses standard operators for formulas, such as a plus sign for addition (+), a minus sign for subtraction\n(-), an asterisk for multiplication (*), a forward slash for division (/), and a caret (^) for exponents.\n\nAll formulas in Excel must begin with an equals sign (=). This is because the cell contains, or is equal to,\nthe formula and the value it calculates.\n\nPage | 57\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\nUnderstanding cell references\nWhile you can create simple formulas in Excel manually (for example, =2+2 or =5*5), most of the time you\nwill use cell addresses to create a formula. This is known as making a cell reference. Using cell references\nwill ensure that your formulas are always accurate because you can change the value of referenced cells\nwithout having to rewrite the formula.\n\nThe formula in cell A3\nrefers to the value in cell A1\nplus the value in cell A2\n\nThe formula calculates\nand displays the answer\nto the equation A1 plus A2\n\nBy combining a mathematical operator with cell references, you can create a variety of simple formulas\nin Excel. Formulas can also include a combination of cell references and numbers, as in the examples\nbelow:\n\nPage | 58\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\nTo create a formula\n1. Select the cell that will contain the formula.\n2. Type the equals sign (=). Notice how it appears in both the cell and the formula bar.\n\nFormula will appear in\nboth the cell and the\nformula bar.\n\n1. Type the cell address of the cell you wish to reference first in the formula: cell D1 in our example.\nA blue border will appear around the referenced cell.\n2. Type the mathematical operator you wish to use. In our example, we'll type the addition sign (+).\n3. Type the cell address of the cell you wish to reference second in the formula: cell D2 in our\nexample. A red border will appear around the referenced cell.\n\n4. Press Enter on your keyboard. The formula will be calculated, and the value will be displayed in the\ncell.\n\uf021 TIP: If the result of a formula is too large to be displayed in a cell, it may appear as pound\nsigns (#######) instead of a value. This means that the column is not wide enough to display the\ncell content. Simply increase the column width to show the cell content.\n\nModifying values with cell references\nThe true advantage of cell references is that they allow you to update data in your worksheet without\nhaving to rewrite formulas.\n\uf021 TIP: Excel will not always tell you if your formula contains an error, so it's up to you to check all of\nyour formulas.\n\nPage | 59\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\nTo create a formula using the point-and-click method\nRather than typing cell addresses manually, you can point and click on the cells you wish to include in your\nformula. This method can save a lot of time and effort when creating formulas. In our example below,\nwe'll create a formula to calculate the cost of ordering several boxes of plastic silverware.\n1. Select the cell that will contain the formula. In our example, we'll select cell D3.\n\n2. Type the equals sign (=).\n3. Select the cell you wish to reference first in the formula: cell B3 in our example. The cell address\nwill appear in the formula, and a dashed blue line will appear around the referenced cell.\n\n4. Type the mathematical operator you wish to use. In our example, we'll type the multiplication sign\n(*).\n5. Select the cell you wish to reference second in the formula: cell C3 in our example. The cell address\nwill appear in the formula, and a dashed red line will appear around the referenced cell.\n\nPage | 60\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\n6. Press Enter on your keyboard. The formula will be calculated, and the value will be displayed in the\ncell.\n\nFormulas can also be copied to adjacent cells with the fill handle, which can save a lot of time and effort\nif you need to perform the same calculation multiple times in a worksheet.\nTo edit a formula\nSometimes you may want to modify an existing formula. In the example below, we've entered an incorrect\ncell address in our formula, so we'll need to correct it.\n1. Select the cell containing the formula you wish to edit.\n2. Click the formula bar to edit the formula. You can also double-click the cell to view and edit the\nformula directly within the cell.\n3. A border will appear around any referenced cells.\n4. When finished, press Enter on your keyboard or select the Enter command\n\nin the formula bar.\n\n5. The formula will be updated, and the new value will be displayed in the cell.\n\uf021 TIP: If you change your mind, you can press the Esc key on your keyboard or click the Cancel\ncommand\n\nin the formula bar to avoid accidentally making changes to your formula.\n\nPage | 61\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\n\uf021 TIP: To show all of the formulas in a spreadsheet, you can hold the Ctrl key and press ` (grave\naccent). The grave accent key is usually located in the upper-left corner of the keyboard. You can\npress Ctrl+` again to switch back to the normal view.\n\nChallenge!\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.2.\n\nOpen an existing Excel workbook.\nCreate a simple addition formula using cell references.\nTry modifying the value of a cell referenced in a formula.\nTry using the point-and-click method to create a formula.\nEdit a formula using the formula bar.\nComplex Formulas\n\nA simple formula is a mathematical expression with one operator, such as 7+9. A complex formula has\nmore than one mathematical operator, such as 5+2*8. When there is more than one operation in a\nformula, the order of operations tells Excel which operation to calculate first. In order to use Excel to\ncalculate complex formulas, you will need to understand the order of operations.\nOrder of operations\nExcel calculates formulas based on the following order of operations:\n1. Operations enclosed in parentheses\n2. Exponential calculations (3^2, for example)\n3. Multiplication and division, whichever comes first\n4. Addition and subtraction, whichever comes first\n\nCreating complex formulas\nIn the example below, we will demonstrate how Excel solves a complex formula using the order of\noperations. Here, we want to calculate the cost of sales tax for an invoice. To do this, we'll write our\nformula as =(D2+D3)*0.075 in cell D4. This formula will add the prices of our items together and then\nmultiply that value by the 7.5% tax rate (which is written as 0.075) to calculate the cost of sales tax.\n\nPage | 62\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\n\uf021 TIP: It is especially important to enter complex formulas with the correct order of operations.\nOtherwise, Excel will not calculate the results accurately. In our example, if the parentheses are\nnot included, the multiplication is calculated first and the result is incorrect. Parentheses are the\nbest way to define which calculations will be performed first in Excel.\n\nChallenge!\n1. Open an existing Excel workbook.\n2. Create a complex formula that will perform addition before multiplication.\n6.2.1. Relative and Absolute Cell References\nThere are two types of cell references: relative and absolute. Relative and absolute references behave\ndifferently when copied and filled to other cells. Relative references change when a formula is copied to\nanother cell. Absolute references, on the other hand, remain constant, no matter where they are copied.\n\n6.2.2. Relative cell references\nBy default, all cell references are relative references. When copied across multiple cells, they change based\non the relative position of rows and columns. For example, if you copy the formula =A1+B1 from row 1 to\nrow 2, the formula will become =A2+B2. Relative references are especially convenient whenever you need\nto repeat the same calculation across multiple rows or columns.\n\nTo create and copy a formula using relative references\nIn the following example, we want to create a formula that will multiply each item's price by the quantity.\nRather than creating a new formula for each row, we can create a single formula in cell D2 and then copy\n\nPage | 63\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\nit to the other rows. We'll use relative references so the formula correctly calculates the total for each\nitem.\n1. Select the cell that will contain the formula. In our example, we'll select cell D2.\n2. Enter the formula to calculate the desired value. In our example, we'll type =B2*C2.\n\n3. Press Enter on your keyboard. The formula will be calculated, and the result will be displayed in\nthe cell.\n4. Locate the fill handle in the lower-right corner of the desired cell. In our example, we'll locate the\nfill handle for cell D2.\n\nThe fill handle\n\nPage | 64\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\n5. Click, hold, and drag the fill handle over the cells you wish to fill.\n\nClick, hold and drag the fill handle to\ncopy the formula to adjacent cells\n\n6. Release the mouse. The formula will be copied to the selected cells with relative references, and\nthe values will be calculated in each cell.\n\n\uf021 TIP: You can double-click the filled cells to check their formulas for accuracy. The relative cell\nreferences should be different for each cell, depending on their rows.\n\nPage | 65\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\n6.2.3. Absolute cell references\nThere may be times when you do not want a cell reference to change when filling cells. Unlike relative\nreferences, absolute references do not change when copied or filled. You can use an absolute reference to\nkeep a row and/or column constant.\nAn absolute reference is designated in a formula by the addition of a dollar sign ($). It can precede the\ncolumn reference, the row reference, or both.\n\nYou will generally use the $A$2 format when creating formulas that contain absolute references. The\nother two formats are used much less frequently.\n\uf021 TIP: When writing a formula, you can press the F4 key on your keyboard to switch between relative\nand absolute cell references. This is an easy way to quickly insert an absolute reference.\n\nTo create and copy a formula using absolute references\nIn our example, we'll use the 7.5% sales tax rate in cell E1 to calculate the sales tax for all items in column\nD. We'll need to use the absolute cell reference $E$1 in our formula. Since each formula is using the same\ntax rate, we want that reference to remain constant when the formula is copied and filled to other cells\nin column D.\n1. Select the cell that will contain the formula. In our example, we'll select cell D3.\n2. Enter the formula to calculate the desired value. In our example, we'll type =(B3*C3)*$E$1.\n3. Press Enter on your keyboard. The formula will calculate, and the result will display in the cell.\n\nPage | 66\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\n4. Locate the fill handle in the lower-right corner of the desired cell.\n5. Release the mouse. The formula will be copied to the selected cells with an absolute reference,\nand the values will be calculated in each cell.\nChallenge!\n1. Open an existing Excel workbook.\n2. Create a formula that uses a relative reference. Double-click a cell to see the copied formula and\nthe relative cell references.\n3. Create a formula that uses an absolute reference.\n6.3.\n\nFunctions\n\nA function is a predefined formula that performs calculations using specific values in a particular order.\nExcel includes many common functions that can be useful for quickly finding the sum, average, count,\nmaximum value, and minimum value for a range of cells. In order to use functions correctly, you'll need to\nunderstand the different parts of a function and how to create arguments to calculate values and cell\nreferences.\nFormula =A1+A2+A3+A4+A5+A6+A7+A8\nFunction =SUM(A1:A8)\nThe parts of a function\nIn order to work correctly, a function must be written a specific way, which is called the syntax. The basic\nsyntax for a function is an equals sign (=), the function name (SUM, for example), and one or more\narguments. Arguments contain the information you want to calculate.\n\nPage | 67\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\n=SUM(A1:A20)\nEqual sign\n\nArgument\nFunction name\n\nWorking with arguments\nArguments can refer to both individual cells and cell ranges and must be enclosed within parentheses. You\ncan include one argument or multiple arguments, depending on the syntax required for the function.\n\nFor example, the function =AVERAGE(B1:B9) would calculate the average of the values in the cell range\nB1:B9. This function contains only one argument.\n\nMultiple arguments must be separated by a comma. For example, the function =SUM(A1:A3, C1:C2, E2)\nwill add the values of all the cells in the three arguments.\n\nPage | 68\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\n6.3.1. Creating a function\nExcel has a variety of functions available. Here are some of the most common functions you'll use:\n\uf0b7\n\nSUM: This function adds all of the values of the cells in the argument.\n\n\uf0b7\n\nAVERAGE: This function determines the average of the values included in the argument. It\ncalculates the sum of the cells and then divides that value by the number of cells in the argument.\n\n\uf0b7\n\nCOUNT: This function counts the number of cells with numerical data in the argument. This\nfunction is useful for quickly counting items in a cell range.\n\n\uf0b7\n\nMAX: This function determines the highest cell value included in the argument.\n\n\uf0b7\n\nMIN: This function determines the lowest cell value included in the argument.\n\nTo create a basic function\nIn our example below, we'll create a basic function to calculate the average price per unit for a list of\nrecently ordered items using the AVERAGE function.\n1. Select the cell that will contain the function.\n2. Type the equals sign (=) and enter the desired function name. You can also select the desired\nfunction from the list of suggested functions that will appear below the cell as you type. In our\nexample, we'll type =AVERAGE.\n\nPage | 69\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\n3. Enter the cell range for the argument inside parentheses. In our example, we'll type (D3:D12).\n4. Press Enter on your keyboard. The function will be calculated, and the result will appear in the cell.\n\nTo create a function using the AutoSum command\nThe AutoSum command allows you to automatically insert the most common functions into your formula,\nincluding SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, MIN, and MAX. In our example below, we'll create a function to\ncalculate the total cost for a list of recently ordered items using the SUM function.\n1. Select the cell that will contain the function.\n2. In the Editing group on the Home tab, locate and select the arrow next to the AutoSum command\nand then choose the desired function from the drop-down menu. In our example, we'll select Sum.\n\nPage | 70\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\n3. The selected function will appear in the cell. If logically placed, the AutoSum command will\nautomatically select a cell range for the argument. You can also manually enter the desired cell\nrange into the argument.\n\n4. Press Enter on your keyboard.\n\n6.3.2. The Function Library\nWhile there are hundreds of functions in Excel, the ones you use most frequently will depend on the type\nof data your workbooks contains. There is no need to learn every single function, but exploring some of\nthe different types of functions will be helpful as you create new projects. You can search for functions by\ncategory, such as Financial, Logical, Text, Date & Time, and more from the Function Library on the Formulas\ntab.\n\uf0fe\n\nTo access the Function Library, select the Formulas tab on the Ribbon. The Function Library will\nappear.\n\nPage | 71\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\n\uf071 If you're having trouble finding the right function, the Insert Function command allows you to\nsearch for functions using keywords.\n\uf071 The AutoSum command allows you to automatically return results for common functions, like\nSUM, AVERAGE, and COUNT.\n\uf071 The Recently Used command gives you access to functions that you have recently worked with.\n\uf071 The Financial category contains functions for financial calculations like determining a payment (PMT) or\ninterest rate for a loan (RATE).\n\n\uf071 Functions in the Logical category check arguments for a value or condition. For example, if an order is over\n$50 add $4.99 for shipping, but if it is over $100, do not charge for shipping (IF).\n\n\uf071 The Text category contains functions that work with the text in arguments to perform tasks, such as\nconverting text to lowercase (LOWER) or replacing text (REPLACE).\n\n\uf071 The Date & Time category contains functions for working with dates and time and will return results like\nthe current date and time (NOW) or the seconds (SECOND).\n\n\uf071 The Lookup & Reference category contains functions that will return results for finding and referencing\ninformation. For example, you can add a hyperlink (HYPERLINK) to a cell or return the value of a particular\nrow and column intersection (INDEX).\n\n\uf071 The Math & Trig category includes functions for numerical arguments. For example, you can round values\n(ROUND), find the value of Pi (PI) multiply (PRODUCT), subtotal (SUBTOTAL), and much more.\n\n\uf071 More Functions contains additional functions under categories for Statistical, Engineering, Cube,\nInformation, and Compatibility.\n\nTo insert a function from the Function Library\n1. Select the cell that will contain the function.\n2. Click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon to access the Function Library.\n3. From the Function Library group, select the desired function category.\n4. Select the desired function from the drop-down menu.\n\nPage | 72\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\n5. The Function Arguments dialog box will appear. From here, you'll be able to enter or select the\ncells that will make up the arguments in the function.\n\n6. When you're satisfied with the arguments, click OK.\n7. The function will be calculated, and the result will appear in the cell.\n\nPage | 73\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\nLike formulas, functions can be copied to adjacent cells. Hover the mouse over the cell that contains the\nfunction, then click, hold, and drag the fill handle over the cells you wish to fill. The function will be copied,\nand values for those cells will be calculated relative to their rows or columns.\n\n6.3.3. The Insert Function command\nIf you're having trouble finding the right function, the Insert Function command allows you to search for\nfunctions using keywords. While it can be extremely useful, this command is sometimes a little difficult to\nuse. If you don't have much experience with functions, you may have more success browsing the Function\nLibrary instead. For more advanced users, however, the Insert Function command can be a powerful way\nto find a function quickly.\n\nTo use the Insert Function command\n1. Select the cell that will contain the function.\n2. Click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon, then select the Insert Function command.\n3. The Insert Function dialog box will appear.\n4. Type a few keywords describing the calculation you want the function to perform, then click Go.\n5. Review the results to find the desired function, then click OK.\n\nPage | 74\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\n6. The Function Arguments dialog box will appear.\n7. When you're satisfied, click OK.\n8. The function will be calculated, and the result will appear in the cell.\n\nChallenge!\n1. Open an existing Excel workbook.\n2. Create a function that contains one argument. If you're using the example, use the SUM function\nin cell B16 to calculate the total quantity of items ordered.\n3. Use the AutoSum command to insert a function.\n4. Explore the Function Library, and try using the Insert Function command to search for different\ntypes of functions.\n\nPage | 75\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\nExcel Formulas You Should Definitely Know\n1. SUM\nFormula: =SUM(5, 5) or =SUM(A1, B1) or =SUM(A1:B5)\nThe SUM formula does exactly what you would expect. It allows you to add 2 or more numbers together.\nYou can use cell references as well in this formula.\n\n2. COUNT\nFormula: =COUNT(A1:A10)\nThe count formula counts the number of cells in a range that have numbers in them.\n\nIt only counts the cells where there are numbers.\n\n3. COUNTA\nFormula: =COUNTA(A1:A10)\nCounts the number of non-empty cells in a range. It will count cells that have numbers and/or any other\ncharacters in them.\nThe COUNTA Formula works with all data types.\n\nPage | 76\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\nIt counts the number of non-empty cells no matter the data type.\n4. LEN\nFormula: =LEN(A1)\nThe LEN formula counts the number of characters in a cell. This includes spaces!\n\nNotice the difference in the formula results: 10 characters without spaces in between the words, 12 with\nspaces between the words.\n5. VLOOKUP\nFormula: =VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, range_lookup)\nBasically, VLOOKUP lets you search for specific information in your spreadsheet. For example, if you have\na list of products with prices, you could search for the price of a specific item.\nWe\u2019re going to use VLOOKUP to find the price of the Photo frame. You can probably already see that the\nprice is $9.99, but that\u2019s because this is a simple example. Once you learn how to use VLOOKUP, you\u2019ll be\nable to use it with larger, more complex spreadsheets, and that\u2019s when it will become truly useful.\n\nPage | 77\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\nAs with any formula, you\u2019ll start with an equal sign (=). Then, type the formula name.\n=VLOOKUP(\u201cPhoto frame\u201d\nThe second argument is the cell range that contains the data. In this example, our data is in A2:B16. As\nwith any function, you\u2019ll need to use a comma to separate each argument:\n=VLOOKUP(\u201cPhoto frame\u201d, A2:B16\nNote: It\u2019s important to know that VLOOKUP will always search the first column in this range. In this\nexample, it will search column A for \u201cPhoto frame\u201d. In some cases, you may need to move the columns\naround so that the first column contains the correct data.\nThe third argument is the column index number. It\u2019s simpler than it sounds: The first column in the range\nis 1, the second column is 2, etc. In this case, we are trying to find the price of the item, and the prices are\ncontained in the second column. That means our third argument will be 2:\n=VLOOKUP(\u201cPhoto frame\u201d, A2:B16, 2\nThe fourth argument tells VLOOKUP whether to look for approximate matches, and it can be either TRUE\nor FALSE. If it is TRUE, it will look for approximate matches. Generally, this is only useful if the first column\nhas numerical values that have been sorted. Since we\u2019re only looking for exact matches, the fourth\nargument should be FALSE. This is our last argument, so go ahead and close the parentheses:\n=VLOOKUP(\u201cPhoto frame\u201d, A2:B16, 2, FALSE)\nAnd that\u2019s it! When you press enter, it should give you the answer, which is 9.99.\n\nPage | 78\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\n6. IF Statements\nFormula: =IF(logical_statement, return this if logical statement is true, return this if logical statement is\nfalse).\nExample\nLet\u2019s say a salesperson has a quota to meet. You used VLOOKUP to put the revenue next to the name. Now you can\nuse an IF statement that says: \u201cIF the salesperson met their quota, say \u201cMet quota\u201d, if not say \u201cDid not meet quota\u201d\n\n=IF(C3>D3, \u201cMet Quota\u201d, \u201cDid Not Meet Quota\u201d)\nThis IF statement will tell us if the first salesperson met their quota or not. We would then copy and paste\nthis formula along all the entries in the list. It would change for each sales person.\n\nPage | 79\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\n7. Working with Data\nWhenever you're working with a lot of data, it can be difficult to compare information in your workbook.\n7.1 Freezing Panes and View Options\nExcel includes several tools that make it easier to view content from different parts of your workbook at\nthe same time, such as the ability to freeze panes and split your worksheet.\nTo freeze rows\nYou may want to see certain rows or columns all the time in your worksheet, especially header cells. By\nfreezing rows or columns in place, you'll be able to scroll through your content while continuing to view\nthe frozen cells.\n1. Select the row below the row(s) you wish to freeze.\n2. Click the View tab on the Ribbon.\n3. Select the Freeze Panes command, then choose Freeze Panes from the drop-down menu.\n\nThe rows will be frozen in place, as indicated by the gray line. You can scroll down the worksheet while\ncontinuing to view the frozen rows at the top.\nTo freeze columns\n1. Select the column to the right of the column(s) you wish to freeze.\n\nPage | 80\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\n2. Click the View tab on the Ribbon.\n3. Select the Freeze Panes command, then choose Freeze Panes from the drop-down menu.\n4. The column will be frozen in place, as indicated by the gray line. You can scroll across the\nworksheet while continuing to view the frozen column on the left.\nTo unfreeze rows or columns, click the Freeze Panes command, then select Unfreeze Panes from the\ndrop-down menu.\n\nTo split a worksheet\nSometimes you may want to compare different sections of the same workbook without creating a new\nwindow. The Split command allows you to divide the worksheet into multiple panes that scroll\nseparately.\n1. Select the cell where you wish to split the worksheet.\n2. Click the View tab on the Ribbon, then select the Split command.\n\n3. The workbook will be split into different panes. You can scroll through each pane separately\nusing the scroll bars, allowing you to compare different sections of the workbook.\nTo remove the split, click the Split command again.\n\nChallenge!\n1. Open an existing Excel workbook.\n2. Try freezing a row or column in place.\n3. Use the Split command to split your worksheet into multiple panes.\n7.2 Sorting Data\nAs you add more content to a worksheet, organizing that information becomes especially important. You\ncan quickly reorganize a worksheet by sorting your data. For example, you could organize a list of contact\ninformation by last name. Content can be sorted alphabetically, numerically, and in many other ways.\nPage | 81\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\nWhen sorting data, it's important to first decide if you would like the sort to apply to the entire worksheet\nor just a cell range.\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\nSort sheet organizes all of the data in your worksheet by one column.\nSort range sorts the data in a range of cells, which can be helpful when working with a sheet that\ncontains several tables. Sorting a range will not affect other content on the worksheet.\n\nTo sort a sheet\nIn our example, we'll sort a T-shirt order form alphabetically by Last Name (column C).\n1. Select a cell in the column you wish to sort by. In our example, we'll select cell C2.\n\n2. Select the Data tab on the Ribbon, then click the Ascending command\nto Sort A to Z, or the\nDescending command to Sort Z to A. In our example, we'll click the Ascending command.\n\n3. The worksheet will be sorted by the selected column. In our example, the worksheet is now sorted\nby last name.\n\nPage | 82\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\n7.3 Filtering Data\nIf your worksheet contains a lot of content, it can be difficult to find information quickly. Filters can be\nused to narrow down the data in your worksheet, allowing you to view only the information you need.\nTo filter data\n1. In order for filtering to work correctly, your worksheet should include a header row, which is used\nto identify the name of each column.\n2. Select the Data tab, then click the Filter command.\n\n3. A drop-down arrow\n\nwill appear in the header cell for each column.\n\n4. Click the drop-down arrow for the column you wish to filter.\n\nPage | 83\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\n5. The Filter menu will appear.\n6. Uncheck the box next to Select All to quickly deselect all data.\n7. Check the boxes next to the data you wish to filter, then click OK.\nTo remove all filters from your worksheet, click the Filter command on the Data tab.\n\n8. Working with Charts\nCreating a chart in Microsoft Office Excel is quick and easy. Excel provides a variety of chart types that you\ncan choose from when you create a chart. Excel offers Pie, Line, Bar, and Column charts to name but a\nfew. Showing data in a chart can make it clearer, more interesting and easier to read. Charts can also help\nyou evaluate your data and make comparisons between different values.\n\n8.1.\n\nUnderstanding charts\n\nExcel has several different types of charts, allowing you to choose the one that best fits your data. In order\nto use charts effectively, you'll need to understand how different charts are used.\nTypes of Charts:\n\uf071 Column charts use vertical bars to represent data. They can work with many different types of\ndata, but they're most frequently used for comparing information.\n\uf071 Line charts are ideal for showing trends. The data points are connected with lines, making it easy\nto see whether values are increasing or decreasing over time.\n\uf071 Pie charts make it easy to compare proportions. Each value is shown as a slice of the pie, so it's\neasy to see which values make up the percentage of a whole.\n\uf071 Bar charts work just like Column charts, but they use horizontal bars instead of vertical bars.\n\uf071 Area charts are similar to line charts, except that the areas under the lines are filled in.\n\uf071 Surface charts allow you to display data across a 3D landscape. They work best with large data sets,\nallowing you to see a variety of information at the same time.\n\nTo insert a chart\n1. Select the cells you want to chart, including the column titles and row labels. These cells will be\nthe source data for the chart.\nPage | 84\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\n2. From the Insert tab, click the desired Chart command.\n3. Choose the desired chart type from the drop-down menu.\n\n4. The selected chart will be inserted in the worksheet.\n\uf021 TIP: If you're not sure which type of chart to use, the Recommended Charts command will\nsuggest several different charts based on the source data.\n\n8.2.\n\nChart layout and style\n\nAfter inserting a chart, there are several things you may want to change about the way your data is\ndisplayed. It's easy to edit a chart's layout and style from the Design tab.\n\uf0fe\n\nExcel allows you to add chart elements\u2014such as chart titles, legends, and data labels\u2014to make\nyour chart easier to read. To add a chart element, click the Add Chart Element command on the\nDesign tab, then choose the desired element from the drop-down menu.\n\nPage | 85\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\n\uf0fe\n\nTo edit a chart element, like a chart title, simply double-click the placeholder and begin typing.\n\n\uf0fe\n\nIf you don't want to add chart elements individually, you can use one of Excel's predefined layouts.\nSimply click the Quick Layout command, then choose the desired layout from the drop-down\nmenu.\n\n\uf0fe\n\nExcel also includes several different chart styles, which allow you to quickly modify the look and\nfeel of your chart. To change the chart style, select the desired style from the Chart styles group.\n\nPage | 86\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\n\uf021 TIP: You can also use the chart formatting shortcut buttons to quickly add chart elements, change\nthe chart style, and filter the chart data.\n\n8.3.\n\nOther chart options\n\nThere are lots of other ways to customize and organize your charts. For example, Excel allows you to\nrearrange a chart's data, change the chart type, and even move the chart to a different location in the\nworkbook.\nTo switch row and column data\nSometimes you may want to change the way charts group your data. For example, in the chart below, the\nBook Sales data are grouped by year, with columns for each genre. However, we could switch the rows\nand columns so the chart will group the data by genre, with columns for each year. In both cases, the chart\ncontains the same data\u2014it's just organized differently.\n1. Select the chart you wish to modify.\nPage | 87\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\n2. From the Design tab, select the Switch Row/Column command.\n\n3. The rows and columns will be switched.\n\nTo change the chart type\nIf you find that your data isn't well suited to a certain chart, it's easy to switch to a new chart type. In our\nexample, we'll change our chart from a Column chart to a Line chart.\n1. From the Design tab, click the Change Chart Type command.\n\n2. The Change Chart Type dialog box will appear.\n3. The selected chart type will appear.\n\nTo move a chart\nWhenever you insert a new chart, it will appear as an object on the same worksheet that contains its\nsource data. Alternatively, you can move the chart to a new worksheet to help keep your data organized.\n1. Select the chart you wish to move.\n2. Click the Design tab, then select the Move Chart command.\n\nPage | 88\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\n3. The Move Chart dialog box will appear. Select the desired location for the chart.\n4. Click OK.\n5. The chart will appear in the selected location.\n\nChallenge!\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n\nOpen an existing Excel workbook.\nUse worksheet data to create a chart.\nChange the chart layout.\nApply a chart style.\nMove the chart.\n\n9. Printing Workbooks\nThere may be times when you want to print a workbook to view and share your data offline. Once you've\nchosen your page layout settings, it's easy to preview and print a workbook from Excel using the Print\npane.\n\nTo access the Print pane\n1. Select the File tab. Backstage view will appear.\n\n2. Select Print. The Print pane will appear.\n\nPage | 89\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\nHere you can choose how\nmany copies of the\nworkbook you wish to print.\n\nWhen you are ready to\nprint the workbook,\nclick the Print button.\nYou may need to select the printer\nyou want to use if your computer is\nconnected to multiple printers.\n\nHere you can choose to print\nthe active sheets, the entire\nworkbook, or a selection of\ncells.\nHere you can choose\nwhether to print on one side\nor both sides of the paper.\n\nIf you are printing multiple copies,\nyou can choose whether you want\nthe copies collated or uncollated.\n\nHere you can choose Portrait\nor Landscape orientation.\nIf your printer uses different\npaper sizes, you can choose the\npaper size you wish to use.\nHere you can adjust the\npage margins, which can\nhelp your data fit more\ncomfortably on the page.\n\nHere you can choose how to scale your\nworksheets for the printed page. You can\nscale worksheets at their actual size, fit the\nentire worksheet on one page, fit all columns\non one page, or fit all rows on one page.\n\n9.1.\n\nChoosing a print area\n\nBefore you print an Excel workbook, it's important to decide exactly what information you want to print.\nFor example, if you have multiple worksheets in your workbook, you will need to decide if you want to\nprint the entire workbook or only active worksheets. There may also be times when you want to print only\na selection of content from your workbook.\nPage | 90\n\n\fExcel Training - Level 1\n\nTo print active sheets\nWorksheets are considered active when selected.\n1. Select the worksheet you want to print. To print multiple worksheets, click the first worksheet, hold\nthe Ctrl key on your keyboard, then click any other worksheets you want to select.\n\n2. Navigate to the Print pane.\n3. Select Print Active Sheets from the Print Range drop-down menu.\n\n4. Click the Print button.\n\nTo print the entire workbook\n1. Navigate to the Print pane.\n2.

It is at intermediate level and is\nintended for those with previous experience in using Excel. Intermediate means different\nthings to different people, and from time to time people find parts of the course easier or\nmore difficult that they expected. The main purpose of the course is to enhance your\nExcel knowledge, and to ensure you to leave the course with greater knowledge than\nyou had when you arrived.\nMany people don\u2019t finish the book on the day as it contains many exercises, and not all\nof the exercises are relevant for everyone. You can carry on with the exercises in your\nown time, the location of the workfiles can be found towards the end of this workbook.\nWith increased Excel knowledge you will be able to carry out aspects of your work more\nefficiently. You may also find use for Excel at home e.g. for working out your budget or\nstoring information on CDs, household items etc\nThe main topics covered today are\nFormula Referencing\nSummarising and Subtotalling\nManaging Worksheets\nLogical and Lookup functions\nFilters and Pivot Tables.\nThese topics have been chosen because they are the most frequently requested Excel\ntopics in the University. If there are other areas you think it would be worth creating\nexercises in please let the tutor know.\n\nRecap on the uses of Excel\nExcel is an electronic spreadsheet application that can be used for storing, organizing\nand manipulating information. Excel is very flexible as it allows you to choose how you\nwish to structure the information you enter.\nYou will most likely be aware of many of the uses of Excel, these include:\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\nbudget forecasting e.g. income and expenditure, annual business reports\ninvoicing\nstoring information e.g. student records, patient records, research data\ndemonstration tool e.g. to show how you arrived at the result of your calculation\nscientific and statistical analysis\ntracking and decision making tool\n\nWe hope you enjoy this course and find it useful. If you have any questions on the\ncourse the tutors will be happy to answer them.\n\n1\n\n\f1. Absolute and relative cell referencing\nExcel is frequently used to carry out calculations using formulas. These formulas are\ncreated using cell references e.g. B3 or D5 rather than actual values, e.g. 2.8 or 5.3.\nUsing cell references allows a change of variable in one cell to be reflected in any\ndependent cells.\n\nRelative referencing\nBy default, cell references in a formula are relative which means that when the formula is\ncopied elsewhere the references will adjust, relative to their new position.\nThe use of cell references rather than actual values for formulas provides flexibility and\nenables:\n1. Copying of formulas to other cells to quickly repeat a calculation.\nThis saves time when working with complex formulas, and if the calculation\nneeds to be repeated several times.\n2. The calculation results will be automatically updated when the source cell values\nchange.\nFor example the formula in cell C1 is =A1+B1\nWhen you copy the formula to another area of the\nspreadsheet the cell references will change to reflect the new\nlocation. This is called relative referencing because the cell\naddress changes relative to the location. You can then\nduplicate the formula in other cells.\nIf the value in either A1 or B1 changes then this is immediately reflected in cell C1\nbecause cell references rather than values are used.\nRelative references adjust to location.\nIn another example where a range of cells is added up\n=SUM(B3:B7) copied becomes =SUM(C3:C7)\n\nAbsolute referencing\nAt times you may need the cell reference in a formula to remain fixed in a specific\nlocation. For example you may wish to store a currency exchange rate in one cell.\nWhen a cell reference in a formula is absolute, the reference does not change when\nthe formula is copied.\nWhen you multiply a particular value by the exchange rate you want the exchange rate\nto remain constant and ensure your formula always refers to the same cell.\nTo fix cell references and\nmake them absolute place a $\nsign in front of the row and\ncolumn co-ordinates e.g. to\nmultiply the value in B4 by the\nexchange rate in G4, first\nchange G4 to $G$4, then copy\nthe formula down the column\n=B4*$G$4\nAbsolute references remain constant regardless of location. The $ sign is used\ne.g. $G$4 to make cells absolute.\n2\n\n\fExcel Intermediate\n\nMixed referencing\nA mixed reference is one where either the column letter or the row number is fixed, for\nexample:\n$A1 (if the formula is copied, the column letter will not change) or\nA$1 (if the formula is copied, the row number will not change)\n\nTask 1.1 Relative formulas\nMost formulas in Excel will be relative resulting in cell references changing when the\nformulas are copied to other locations.\n1.\n\nOpen the file Absolute1\n\n2.\n\nClick in cell B9\n\n3.\n\nClick the down arrow next to AutoSum in the Editing group on the\nHome tab, select Sum and press Enter\n\n4.\n\nClick on B9 again, and drag the small square handle (the fill handle) at the bottom\nright corner of the cell along to E9. (This copies the formula from\nB9 to E9)\n\n5.\n\nClick in the cell F6\n\n6.\n\nSelect the Sum command\nand click Enter\n\n7.\n\nClick on F6 again and\ndrag the fill handle to F9.\n(This will copy the formula\nfrom F6 to F9). Save and\nclose the workbook.\n\nThis is copying relative cell references. We will now look at using absolute referencing.\n\nTask 1.2\n\nWhen relative formulas are inappropriate\n\nSometimes a value in a formula needs to be located in a specific cell, row or column i.e.\nthe formula must include an absolute cell reference. This exercise illustrates what\nhappens when the formula doesn\u2019t work as required.\n1.\n\nOpen the file Absolute2\n\n2.\n\nClick in C11 (we want to calculate the\nproduct\u2019s surcharge)\n\n3.\n\nType =B11*B5 and press Enter\n\n4.\n\nClick in C11 again (we now want to fill\nthe other cells)\n\n5.\n\nMove the mouse pointer to the fill handle\nat the lower right corner\nof the cell and drag\ndown to cell C22\n\nThe results are not what we require.\nAs we filled the cells in column C the value we multiplied by changed from 12% (the\nvalue in B5) to zero (the value in B6 which is empty) and so on down column B.\nWe\u2019ll correct this in the next exercise when we make the cell reference to B5 absolute.\n3\n\n\fTask 1.3\n\nAbsolute references\n\nIn this exercise we need the value we are multiplying by to remain fixed when the\nformula is copied down a column. i.e. we need to make the cell reference absolute.\n1.\n\nUsing the file Absolute2 click in cell C11. Move to the formula bar at the top of the\nscreen, and then click within the B5 cell reference in the\nformula in the formula bar.\n\n2.\n\nPress F4 (the key to change references\nto absolute) several times. Observe that\nthe cell reference changes from $B$5 to\nB$5 to $B5 and then B5 each time you\npress F4\n\n3.\n\nPress F4 until B5 appears as $B$5 and\npress enter\n\n4.\n\nClick in C11 and press enter. Now click\nin C11 again and move the mouse\npointer to the fill handle at the bottom\nright of C11, and drag the handle down to C22 to fill the formulas down the column.\nSave and close the workbook.\n\n\uf0a4Note: When copying a formula, you can make it relative or absolute.\n\u2022 Relative references adjust to location\n\u2022 =SUM(B3:B7) copied becomes =SUM(C3:C7)\nAbsolute references remain fixed regardless of location. Use the $ sign e.g. $A$1\n\n2. Subtotalling\nWe often need to calculate the grand total of values stored in a list. In addition, we may\nneed to subdivide the data and calculate subtotals. Fortunately, Excel provides a subtotal\nfunction which can be used to carry out any subtotal calculations.\nWhen using the subtotalling function the data needs to be \u2018tidy\u2019 e.g:\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\nColumn headings must be unique\nThere should be no blank rows or columns as Excel stops sorting when it meets a\nblank row or column\nThe data must be sorted in the column to be subtotalled\n\nWhen using subtotalling Excel applies outlining to group data. You can use this outlining\nfeature to show and hide details using the expand and collapse buttons.\n\nTask 2.1 Creating subtotals\nWhen subtotalling Excel adds a new row containing the subtotal at each change in the\ndata. It also applies outlining to the list.\n1.\n\nOpen the file ProductSummarising\n\nWe are going to create subtotals so first we will sort the data\n2.\n\nClick on any cell in the Store column\n\n3.\n\nOn the Home tab of the ribbon, click on Sort & Filter in the Editing group and\nselect Sort A to Z\n\nWe now want to add subtotals for each store\n4\n\n\fExcel Intermediate\n4.\n\nClick on the Data tab, then click on Subtotal in the Outline group,\nto display the Subtotal dialog box\n\n5.\n\nClick on the drop arrow for At each change in and click\non Store.\n\n6.\n\nEnsure the other settings are as shown in the screen\nshot and click OK\n\nAn outline will appear in the worksheet and the product costs will be\nsubtotalled at each change in store.\n7.\n\nScroll to the bottom of the data to see that Excel has also calculated\nthe grand total of the costs.\n\nSubtotalling syntax\nWhen you click on a subtotal within the data the formula bar shows the formula\ngenerated by subtotal function. In the case of a subtotal sum the formula is\n`\nThe format of the formula is SUBTOTAL(function_num, ref1, ref2, ...)\nThe function_num specifies the type of function to use in calculating subtotals\nwithin a list. The function number for the subtotal sum is 9. Popular function\nnumbers include average, count and max as listed in the following table:\nFunction\nNumber Function\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n9\n\nAVERAGE\nCOUNT\nCOUNTA\nMAX\nMIN\nPRODUCT\nSTDEV\nSUM\n\nCOUNT counts cells containing numbers\nCOUNTA counts non empty cells\nThe PRODUCT function multiplies all the\nnumbers given as arguments and returns the\nproduct. e.g. if cells A1 and A2 contain\nnumbers, you can use the formula\n=PRODUCT(A1, A2)\nSTDEV The standard deviation is a measure\nof how widely values are dispersed from the\naverage value\n\nThe SUBTOTAL function can be used directly. The first parameter in the sum subtotal\nfunction is 9. i.e. using 9 in the formula tells Excel to sum the figures, using 2 tells Excel\nto count the figures. e.g.\nSubtotal Average\n\n=SUBTOTAL(1, F2:F8)\n\nSubtotal of Count\n\n=SUBTOTAL(2,F2:F8)\n\n5\n\n\fTask 2.2 Nested subtotals\nYou can create another level of subtotalling in addition to subtotals of the cost. Creating\nanother level produces nested subtotals. To create nested subtotals you first sort the\ndata again on the main grouping, and then on the secondary grouping.\n1.\n\nContinue working with the file ProductSummarising and ensure your cursor is\nplaced within the data table.\n\n2.\n\nChoose Sort & Filter on the\nHome tab. Select Custom\nSort\n\n3.\n\nClick the Add Level button\n\n4.\n\nClick the drop down arrow\nfor Then by, choose Product, and click OK\n\n5.\n\nClick OK to the message \u201cThis removes\nthe subtotals and sorts again\u201d.\n\n6.\n\nNow click the Data tab, and choose Subtotal to display the Subtotal dialogue box\n\n7.\n\nClick the drop down arrow for At each change in, choose Store and click OK (the\nsettings should be retained from the previous exercise)\n\nWe will now add a second\nsubtotal\n8.\n\nClick on the Subtotal\nbutton again. This time\nAt each change in\nselect Product\n\n9.\n\nThis time remove the tick\nnext to Replace current\nsubtotals (if it is ticked)\nand click OK\n\nNotice that both the Store and\nProduct subgroups are\nsubtotalled.\n10.\n\nSave and close the workbook.\n\nTip: The subtotal function is used to sum or average sections of data\nIt can be used for creating a subtotal:\nSum, average, maximum or minimum\nExamples of use: student exam marks, sales figures, expenditure records\n\n\uf0a4Note: With Subtotalling and Filtering the data needs to be \u2018tidy\u2019 i.e.\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\n6\n\nColumn headings must be unique\nData must be sorted\nNo blank rows or columns\n\n\fExcel Intermediate\n\n3. Renaming, managing and linking worksheets\nRenaming worksheets\nBy default, Excel names new worksheets consecutively: Sheet1, Sheet2 etc. In order to\nkeep track of, and add meaning to information in your workbooks you can rename them.\n\nTask 3.1 Renaming worksheets\nTo give your sheet a different name to the default, double click the sheet tab, or right\nclick the sheet tab and choose rename.\n1.\n\nOpen the file Linking\n\n2.\n\nActivate the Sheet2 tab and rename it (by double clicking or right clicking\nand choosing rename) as Year2012\n\n3.\n\nRepeat this procedure to rename Sheet3 as Year2013 and Sheet4 as\nYear2014\n\nManaging multiple worksheets\nIn Excel you can insert, move and copy worksheets from one workbook to another. You\ncan also refer to cells and ranges in other worksheets, or other workbooks.\nInserting worksheets\nTo insert a worksheet right-click the tab of the worksheet before which you want to\ninsert the new worksheet, choose insert and select worksheet from the General tab.\nMoving and copying worksheets\nYou can move a worksheet by dragging it to a new location. To copy a worksheet hold\ndown the Ctrl key when dragging the worksheet to a new location.\n\nLinking to other worksheets\nTo link worksheets use references to cells in other worksheets to get data into your main\nworksheet. e.g. you might keep a summary worksheet and link to this from other\nworksheets.\nTo link cells between worksheets precede the source cell reference in the formula with\nthe sheet name, followed by an exclamation mark:\nworksheetname!reference e.g. Year1!C4\n\nTask 3.2 Referring to cells in other worksheets\n1.\n\nContinue working with the file Linking. This worksheet contains data for three\nconsecutive years\u2019 temporary staff hours. It also contains a summary sheet.\n\n2.\n\nEnsure the worksheet Summary Data is activated\n\n3.\n\nClick on cell B6 and type =\n\n4.\n\nClick on the worksheet tab for Year2012, click in cell F6, and press Enter\n\nPressing enter should return you to the sheet Summary Data. We'll now try another\nway of linking sheets\u2026\n5.\n\nOn the sheet Summary Data click on cell B8 and type =Year2012!F4 and press\nEnter\n\n6.\n\nClick on B15 and use the technique in steps 4 or 5 to build the formula:\n=Year2012!F8+Year2013!F8+Year2014!F8 and press Enter.\n7\n\n\f\uf0a4Note: Ensure that there are no spaces at the start and end of the sheet\nnames as these can result in the appearance of the update values box\n\nReferring to cells in other workbooks\nWhen you create a link to another workbook, Excel creates a formula that includes the\nname of the source workbook in brackets [ ], followed by the worksheet name. The\ncombination of workbook name followed by worksheet name needs to be surrounded\nby single quotation marks. Excel follows this with an exclamation mark and the cell\nreference.\n'[workbookname]worksheetname'!reference\n\ne.g. '[Company Sales]Year1'!C4\n\nReferences to other workbooks are called external references. When linking a workbook\nin a particular folder to a workbook in a different folder, the formula must include the full\npath to the workbook. e.g.\n\nPlease note: Linking to other workbooks depends on how your machine is set up. It\nmay not work on training machines.\n\nTask 3.3 Referring to cells in other workbooks\n1.\n\nEnsure the file Linking is still open.\n\n2.\n\nChoose File, New and choose Blank\nWorkbook\n\n3.\n\nEnter the text as in the screenshot\n\n4.\n\nEnsure Linking is still open\n\n5.\n\nClick on B4\n\n6.\n\nType = [Linking.xlsx]Year2012!B8*30%\n\n7.\n\nClick on cell B4 and drag the fill handle in the\nbottom right hand corner of the cell to copy\nthe formula across to E4\n\n8.\n\nSave and close the workbook as Overheads\nReport.xlsx within the folder Excel\nIntermediate 2013 and close the file.\n\n9.\n\nClose the file Linking, save the changes if asked.\n\n\uf0a4Note: If you make a change in the original workbook and then open the second\nworkbook containing links to the original you may get the message This workbook\ncontains links to one or more external sources that could be unsafe. Files stored in\nthe training rooms have been virus scanned so you can choose the option to update\nthe links and get the latest data.\n\n8\n\n\fExcel Intermediate\n\nGrouping Worksheets\nGrouping worksheets enables you to make the same change to all of the selected\nworksheets in one go. This is useful when you need to enter the same information into\nseveral worksheets at once.\n\nTask 3.4 Grouping Worksheets\n1.\n\nOpen the file Grouping Worksheets\n\n2.\n\nClick on the 2014 worksheet tab, hold down the shift key and click on the 2016 tab\nso that the worksheets named 2014, 2015 and 2016 are all selected.\n\n3.\n\nNotice that [Group] appears at the top of the screen after the filename, this\nindicates that grouping has been activated\n\n4.\n\nClick in cell B1 and type Income and Expenditure, format the text to make it bold,\n18pt and blue.\n\n5.\n\nClick in cell A3 and type Income\n\n6.\n\nClick in cell A4 and type Expenditure\n\n7.\n\nClick in cell B2 and type January, format the rest of the text you have typed in and\nmake it bold\n\n8.\n\nClick in cell B2 again and hover over the bottom right\nhand corner of the cell until a + sign appears, click and\ndrag the + sign along to cell M2 so that the cells are\nautomatically filled with January \u2013 December\n\n9.\n\nClick on the 2015 worksheet tab and notice that all the information you have typed\nin sheet 2014 has also been entered into the 2015 worksheet\n\n10.\n\nSave the changes and close the file.\n\n\uf0a4Note: While worksheets are grouped any changes made to one worksheet\nwill appear on every worksheet in the group. However, if you select a worksheet\nthat is not in the group, all of your worksheets will become ungrouped.\n\n9\n\n\f4. Naming a Range\nNaming cell ranges makes the\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\nranges more meaningful and\nformulas easier to understand.\n\nNames can also be used to locate specific places in a spreadsheet. It is best to name\ncells ranges before using formulas:\nDefining a name can be done under the Formula tab, Define Name, New Name\nYou can also define a name by selecting a range\nof cells and typing a name in the name box which\nis to the left of the formula bar.\n\nTask 4.1 Defining Names\nWe will define names to represent ranges in the workbook Sales.\n1.\n\nOpen the file Sales\n\n2.\n\nEnsure the worksheet North is selected\n\n3.\n\nSelect B5:B9\n\n4.\n\nEdit the name box to read NorthWin and press Enter.\n\n5.\n\nName C5:C9 as NorthSpr, press Enter\nName D5:D9 as NorthSum, press Enter\nName E5:E9 as NorthAut, press Enter\n\n6.\n\nGo to the Formulas tab and choose Name Manager to see the list of\nnames.\n\nIf you need to change the name or the cell range click the Edit button within\nthe Name Manager dialogue box.\n\n\uf0a4Note: You can only use letters or numbers in names. Spaces and other\ncharacters are not permitted. Names must also begin with a letter.\n\nUsing Names in Formulas\nOnce range names have been defined they can be used in formulas. Range names are\nstored in Excel's internal listing within the workbook.\n\nTask 4.2 Using Names in Formulas\n1.\n\nEnsure the file Sales is open.\n\n2.\n\nClick on cell B10, type =sum(NorthWin) and press Enter\n\n3.\n\nCalculate the total cakes\nsales for each season in\nthe North. Use the sum\nformula and the names\nNorthSpr, NorthSum and\nNorthAut as appropriate.\n\n4.\n\nSave and close the file.\n\n10\n\n\fExcel Intermediate\n\n5. Functions\nFunctions are predefined formula. The functions\nin Excel fall into various categories including\nmathematical, logical and lookup. Different\ncategories are often used together.\nBasic components of functions are:\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\nthey always begin with an = sign\nthey consist of the name of the function, the arguments, and text and numbers\n\nThe arguments are the data and cell references that the function is carried out on, and\nare contained within brackets. Arguments can also be other functions (nested functions).\nArguments that include cell references can be a range of cells or cells separated by\ncommas.\nIf there is more than one argument a comma must be used to separate them\ne.g.=SUM(C5:D5,B20)\nAll Excel functions can be found via buttons on the formula tab.\n\nThe Sum Function\nThe SUM function adds up ranges of cells. e.g.\n=SUM(A3,B5,D1,E2) or =SUM(B3:D5)\n\nThe Average Function\nThe AVERAGE function works out the arithmetic mean (the sum of a list of numbers\ndivided by the size of the list).\n=AVERAGE(A2,C4,D2) or =AVERAGE(C7:E7)\n\nThe Round Function\nThe ROUND function is used to round a number to a specific number of decimal places.\nThe ROUND function has two arguments.\n=ROUND(D5,0) will round up the number in D5 to 0 decimal places and\n=ROUND(B3,1) will round up the number in B3 to 1 decimal place\n\n\uf0a4Note: The syntax for the ROUND functions is: ROUND(number,numdigits)\nThe first argument of the function is the number you want to round, the second\nargument is the number of digits to which you want to round the number.\n\nTask 5.1 Sum, Average and Round Functions\n1.\n\nOpen the file Marks and have a look at the file.\n\nThe file contains a fictional list of student exam and practical marks. We are going to use\nfunctions in Excel to work out:\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n2.\n\nthe average mark for each student\nwhether they have passed or failed\nthe grade they obtained\nIn cell F7 type =SUM(C7:E7) to calculate the total marks the student obtained.\n11\n\n\f3.\n\nCopy the formula down the column to see the total marks for all the students.\n\n4.\n\nGo to cell G7 and type =AVERAGE(C7:E7) to calculate the average mark for the\nstudent. Copy the formula down the column.\n\n5.\n\nGo to cell H7 and type in =ROUND(G7,0) to round off the average mark to the\nnearest whole number. Copy the formula down the column.\n\nTip: The Round function can be a very useful function. Using the Round\nfunction on a value, rather than using formatting to round, can make a significant\ndifference to subsequent calculations on the rounded value.\n\nLogical Functions\nLogical functions test whether a condition is true or false and can be used in decision\nmaking. The result of the decision can be used to display information or perform\nfurther calculations. Examples of logical functions include IF and IFERROR.\n\nIF\nThe IF function is the fundamental logical function\nfor decision making. It is set out as follows:\n=IF(condition, true, false)\nIf a condition is true then return true, and if false,\nreturn false.\nTrue and false can be substituted by\n\uf0b7 words of your choice surrounded by quotation marks or\n\uf0b7 further calculations or further functions (referred to as nested functions)\ne. g. =IF(C2>=150,\"Signature required\",\"Standard\")\nIn the example above C2>=150 is the condition being tested. i.e. if the value in C2 is\ngreater than or equal to 150 then display the text \u201dSignature required\u201d in D2 otherwise\ndisplay the text \u201cStandard\u201d\n\nTask 5.2 Using IF to return information\nThe IF function can be used to display the result of a condition test. In the following\nexample the IF function is used to display the result 'pass' or 'fail' for students taking a\nparticular course.\n1.\n\nContinue using the file Marks and go to cell I7\n\n2.\n\nType =IF(H7>=50,\"Pass\",\"Fail\") and press enter\n\n3.\n\nCopy the formula down the column\n\nTip: If you want the cell to remain blank if the result is false enter two double\nquotes\" \" instead of text e.g. =IF(H7>=50,\"Pass\",\" \")\n\n12\n\n\fExcel Intermediate\n\nNested Functions\nA nested function is a function which is encapsulated within another function. When this\nhappens the nested function becomes an argument of another function.\n\nNested If\nNested functions are often used in conjunction with the IF function. i.e. you can use\nanother IF function in place of False. If the result of the first condition is false, then the\nsecond condition will be tested.\n\nIn the above example we potentially need to make more than one decision before\narriving at an answer.\nFirst we ask if G7>=70, and if it is, then Excel will enter \"A\" in the cell. However, if G7 is\nless than 70 then we ask another question e.g. is G7>=60, and so on until we enter a\nvalue if all conditions are false.\n\nTask 5.3 Nesting IF Functions\n1.\n\nContinue using the file Marks and click in cell J7.\n\n2.\n\nType =IF(G7>=70,\"A\",\n\nWe now want to make our expression more readable by splitting it over several lines.\nPressing the Alt and Enter keys creates a new line.\n3.\n\nAfter the comma press Alt and Enter to create a new line.\n\n4.\n\nType IF(G7>=60,\"B\", and press Alt and Enter\n\n5.\n\nType IF(G7>=50,\"C\", and press Alt and Enter\n\n6.\n\nType \"Fail\"))) and press Enter\n\n7.\n\nNotice the result in cell J7 and copy the formula down the column.\n\nThe result in J7 is a B and the candidate obtained 69.6667 as an average mark. If the\nresult had been rounded up they would have gained an A. We will see how to remedy\nthe grade in the next exercise.\n8.\n\nTo see the whole formula in the formula bar hover over the bottom of the formula\nbar until a double arrow appears, then pull the formula bar down to increase its\nsize.\n\nTask 5.4 Working out the grade using the round function\nThe different categories of function are often used together, and this exercise illustrates\nthe usefulness of the round function. We will work out the grade using the values from\ncolumn H in which the average result has been rounded to the nearest whole number.\n1.\n\nContinue using the file Marks and click in cell K7\n\n2.\n\nType =IF(H7>=70,\"A\",\n\n3.\n\nType IF(H7>=60,\"B\", and press Alt and Enter\n\n4.\n\nType IF(H7>=50,\"C\", and press Alt and Enter\n\n5.\n\nType \"Fail\"))) and press Enter\n\n6.\n\nNotice the result in cell K7 and copy the formula down the column.\n\n13\n\n\fThe result in K7 is an A. This time we have worked out the grade based on the value in\nH7 which has been rounded to 70. Close the file without saving the changes.\n\n\uf0a4Note: The ROUND function can produce some intriguing results. When using\nROUND(number,numdigits)\n\uf0b7 if the numdigits equals 0 the functions rounds to the nearest whole number.\nROUND(56.78,0) returns 57\n\uf0b7 If numdigits is negative, the function rounds to the left of the decimal point.\nROUND(57.78,-1) returns 60\n\nTask 5.5 Calculating values with the IF Function\nIn addition to returning text results, the IF function can be used to carry out further\ncalculations based on the result of the condition.\ne.g. If the condition is true, the function can carry out a particular calculation and, if the\ncondition is false, the function can carry out an alternative calculation.\n1.\n\nOpen the file called Formulas and ensure the IF worksheet is active\n\n2.\n\nSelect G7. We are going to use the IF function to calculate the commission for\neach salesperson.\n\n3.\n\nType =IF(F7>10000,F7*2%,\"Not applicable\") and press Enter\n\nF7>10000 is the condition that the IF function will evaluate. If the condition is true then\nthe salesperson will be awarded commission to the value of 2% of their total sales. If the\ncondition is false the words Not applicable will appear in the cell.\n4.\n\nCopy the formula in G7 down the column to G21\n\n5.\n\nObserve the results, then save and close the workbook.\n\nLookup Functions\nLookup functions allow you to search a list or table range and return a\nvalue from a cell in that range. They are handy when you have a large\nspread sheet or need to look up something repetitively.\nThey can be used to return:\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\nA text comment or grade based on an exam mark\nData in a specific location\nA product description and price based on its code or name\nEmployee information based on employee id\n\nLookup functions require:\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n14\n\na data table to look in, this is a cell range which can be named\na calculation area where the function is entered and the retrieved values appear\n\n\fExcel Intermediate\n\nThe vlookup function\nVlookup is the vertical lookup function and returns a value on the same row of the range\nof data you are looking in. It has 4 arguments:\nVLOOKUP(lookupValue,lookupTable,colNum,matchType)\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\nlookupValue is the first argument. This value must be located\nin the first column of the lookup table\nlookupTable is the second argument\ncolNum, the third argument is the column number from which\nyou wish to return a value\nmatchType, the forth argument is optional if you do not require\nan exact match. If you specify true or omit the argument the\nfunction searches for an approximate match. If you specify false the\nfunction searches for an exact match to the lookupValue.\n\nA lookup table\n\nTask 5.6 Using vLookup\nThe most common lookup function is VLOOKUP, the vertical lookup. This function\nsearches vertically down a sorted data table looking for a match\n1.\n\nOpen the file StudentLookup and click in cell C2\n\n2.\n\nType the text See tutor, Try harder, Satisfactory, Good, Very\ngood and Excellent into the cell range C2 to C7 (See screen shot).\nThis completes the data table that we are going to look up values in.\n\nObserve that the data table is already sorted which is essential\nbefore using vlookup.\nWe shall now name the data table to make the cell ranges easier to\nrefer to.\n3.\n\nHighlight cells A1 to C7\n\n4.\n\nEdit the Name Box (to the left of the formula bar) to read\nComment\n\n5.\n\nClick in cell D11\n\n6.\n\nType =vlookup(C11,Comment,3) and press Enter\n\nVLOOKUP searches vertically in the range of cells in the table.\nIt searches for a value nearest to the value in C11 in the table Comment and returns the\ndescription in the column you specify (in this case column 3)\n7.\n\nCopy the formula down the column.\n\nThe formula has returned a comment for each mark because we looked for an\napproximate match to each of the marks in the table.\nWhen looking for an approximate match we don't have to include the 4th argument. If the\nvalue lies between two values in the table then vlookup returns the comment next to the\nclosest least value.\n\n15\n\n\fTask 5.7 vLookup for Exact Matches\nOn occasions, you may only want to return a value if an exact match to the value you are\nlooking up is found. This can be achieved by adding a fourth argument match type at\nthe end of the vlookup formula. For exact matches the match type must be set to false.\ne.g. =VLOOKUP(C11,Comment,3,false)\n1.\n\nContinue working with the file\nStudentLookup\n\n2.\n\nClick in cell E11\n\n3.\n\nType =vlookup(C11,Comment,3,false)\nand press enter\n\nExcel will return the result #N/A because there is no exact match for the value 68 in the\nComment table.\n4.\n\nCopy the formula down the column and observe the results.\n\nNotice that Excel has only returned a comment for values that have an exact match in\nthe Comment table. Save the workbook.\n\n\uf0a4Note: It is crucial to sort the table when using lookup functions.\n\nExcel doesn't just\nwork its way down a column, it uses a binary search technique searching out from the middle\nof the list, so if you don\u2019t sort the table first it is likely to produce inaccurate results.\n\n6. Filters\nWhen you are working on a worksheet with many rows of data, it can be difficult\nto view and analyse the data. This is where you can use filters to control what\nyou see.\nFiltering is a quick way to find and work with a subset of data in an Excel range. Filters\nenable you to find all the entries for a particular item in a large worksheet, e.g. an\nemployee name or a product.\nFilters also enable you to select only the data you need, and to hide the data not relevant\nto your search. e.g. the students with the highest grade, or the records for a specific\ndepartment.\nUnlike sorting, filtering does not rearrange your data, it simply hides the rows you\ndon\u2019t want. You can then edit, format, chart and print your filtered data as you wish.\n\nPreparing to filter\nAs with subtotalling, the data in your worksheet needs to be organised before filtering:\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\nUse headings\nDon\u2019t mix the data types\nDon\u2019t have blank rows or columns. Individual blank cells are ok.\nIdeally keep data to be filtered in a separate worksheet\n\nWe are going to look at filtering text and filtering numbers, first filtering text.\n\n16\n\n\fExcel Intermediate\n\nFiltering Text\nThe AutoFilter feature in Excel provides a quick way to create a filter, and can be used\nfor text. To use AutoFilter, click in a cell containing a text data item. Then go to the Data\ntab and select Filter.\n\nTask 6.1 Filtering Text\n1.\n\nOpen the file Filtering\n\n2.\n\nClick in a cell containing text, go to the Data tab and select Filter.\n\n3.\n\nClick on the down arrow next to the Department column heading to begin filtering.\nExcel displays a list of options as well as all the items\nin the column.\n\n4.\n\nDeselect Select All, then tick the box next to\nAccounts and click ok.\nAll rows apart from Accounts are hidden. Notice that\nthe down arrow to the right of Accounts has changed\nto a small filter\nsymbol.\n\n5.\n\nTo add to the selection click on the small filter symbol\nnext to Department, tick the box next to Customer\nsupport (retain the tick next to Accounts) and click ok.\n\nWhere you have applied a filter, the row numbers appear in blue and the drop down\narrow changes to a filter symbol. In addition, the status bar at the bottom of the screen\ndisplays the number of records found.\n\n\uf0a4Note: If you have a blank row or column in your worksheet AutoFilter will not\nprocess the data beyond it.\n\nFiltering options and custom filters\nThe text filtering menu also allows you to set more than one condition and provides\na range of filtering options: Equals, Begins With, Contains etc.\nYou can customise the filter, combining\nvarious options, and filter using various criteria,\nas shown in the screen shot.\nIn addition you can add multiple filter criteria\nand use:\n\uf0b7 the And function where the results returned\nmeet both criteria, or\n\uf0b7 the Or function where the results returned\nmeet either criteria.\nTo create a more powerful filter use wildcards. The wildcard character * can be\nused as a substitute for a series of any characters.\nFor example, when looking for the word millennium the wild character can be used to\ntype mil*en*ium in the search box. This will ensure all instances of the word are\nreturned allowing for various misspellings that can occur.\n\n17\n\n\fTask 6.2 Filtering Text\n1.\n\nContinue using the file Filtering. Click on the filter button to the right of the column\nheading Department and remove the ticks next to Accounts and Customer\nSupport.\n\n2.\n\nOn the filter menu move the mouse to Text Filters and across to Equals.\n\n3.\n\nIn the box to the right of Equals type Admin* and click ok.\n\nNotice that the filter has picked up the records both where Administration has been\ncorrectly and incorrectly typed.\n\nFiltering Numbers\nMany of the filtering options that apply to filtering text also apply to filtering numbers.\nThere are also additional filtering options for numbers. These include searching for the\n\u2018Top 10\u2019 Items. This option does more than its name suggests, it actually searches for\nbetween 1 and 500 items.\n\nTask 6.3 Filtering Numbers\n1.\n\nUsing the file Filtering click on the Department filters and choose Select All.\nClick ok.\n\n2.\n\nMove to the down arrow next to\nEarnings(\u00a3), go to Number Filters and\nselect Top 10\n\n3.\n\nChange the number to the top 6 and click\nok. Observe the results.\n\n4.\n\nReturn to the Number Filters and, using\nthe down arrow, change Top to Bottom to see the 6 lowest earnings. Observe the\nresults.\n\nThe 6 lowest earnings\n\nThe \u2018Top 10\u2019 feature enables you to search for the top or bottom 1 to 500 items. You can\nalso search for the top or bottom percent.\n\nTask 6.4 Removing a filter\nYou can choose to turn off specific columns or turn AutoFilter off completely.\n1.\n\nClick the autofilter symbol at the top of the Earnings column and\nselect Clear Filter From Earnings from the menu\n\n2.\n\nGo the Data tab and click Filter to turn off AutoFilter completely\n\n3.\n\nKeep the file open for the next exercise.\n\nFiltering Dates\nExcel provides many options for filtering a column of dates. For example you can select\nall this or last year\u2019s dates, or all dates that occurred in a particular month.\nIn addition you still have the option to custom filter dates. The example illustrates the use\nof the And function to filter a range of dates.\n18\n\n\fExcel Intermediate\n\nTask 6.5 Filtering Dates\n1.\n\nContinue using the file Filtering. Ensure the cursor is within the data table. Go to\nthe Data tab and click on Filter\n\n2.\n\nClick on the down arrow next to Date of\nHire\n\n3.\n\nGo to Date filters, and choose Custom\nFilter (at the bottom of the list that appears)\n\n4.\n\nSet up the custom filter to select dates after\n09/04/2011 and before 08/12/2013 and\nclick ok\n\nIf you have time try out a couple of the other date filters.\n5.\n\nClose the file without saving the changes.\n\n7. Pivot Tables\nPivot tables enable you to summarise and analyse large amounts of data in lists. This is\ndone by dragging and dropping headings to different row, column, or summary positions.\nUsing Pivot tables you can:\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\nperform a large number of calculations simultaneously and see data trends\nquickly update the data because Pivot tables are dynamic.\n\nPivot Table terminology\nThe four categories (called fields) of information in a Pivot Table are:\nPage\nRow\nColumn\nData\n\nThe page field allows you to filter the entire Pivot Table report to display data\nfor a single item or all the items. e.g. all students, or a specific student.\nThe row field displays the items in the field as row labels.\nThe column field displays the items in the field as column labels.\nData fields contain the summarised data. They are usually numeric, but can\nalso contain text.\n\n19\n\n\fTask 7.1 Create a Pivot Table\nWe are going to use an example containing student names, exam marks, semesters and\nsubjects. Each column has a heading and there are no blank rows in the range or table.\n1.\n\nOpen the file Pivot Tables and place your cursor\nanywhere in the data (but not in the headings) and click on\nthe Insert tab and on PivotTable in the Tables group.\nThe Create PivotTable dialogue box appears.\n\nUnder Choose the data that you want to analyse, Excel\nautomatically determines the range for the PivotTable report.\n2.\n\nUnder Choose where you want the PivotTable report to be\nplaced, choose a new worksheet. Then click OK.\n\n3.\n\nThe area on the right is composed of a field section and an\nareas section. Drag the field student from the field section\nto rows in the areas section, and subject to columns\n\n4.\n\nDrag mark to \u2211 values and semester to filters\nThe data is organised by student and subject, and was\ntotalled when the mark field was dragged to the \u2211 values area:\n\nTips: To reorganise your report you can remove fields and add them to different\nareas in the PivotTable Field List box. This is \u2018pivoting\u2019 the data.\nTo bring back the field list (if it disappears) right click on the PivotTable and choose\nShow Field List\n\nTask 7.2 Display data for specific items\nPivot tables provide filters on the column and row headings to enable you to display data\nfor specific items e.g. semesters or individual student marks.\n1.\n\nClick on the drop down arrow to the right of Semester (All)\nand select Semester 1 to see Semester 1\u2019s marks for all the\nsubjects.\n\n2.\n\nClick on the filter button next to Semester and choose\nSelect All to see all the semesters\u2019 marks again.\n\n3.\n\nClick on the down arrow next to Column Labels, untick Select All and tick the box\nnext to History to see the marks for History.\n\n4.\n\nClick on the filter button next to Column Labels and choose Select All to see all\nthe marks again.\n\n\uf0a4Note: You cannot change the data in a PivotTable directly.\n\nYou must change the\nsource data and then refresh the PivotTable. To do this click on the PivotTable and\nthen the PivotTable Tools, Analyse tab, then click Refresh in the Data group.\n20\n\n\fExcel Intermediate\n\nFormatting the data\nPivotTable data can be displayed in various ways. By default PivotTables summarise\ntotal data. However the data can also be summarised in various ways, including:\n\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\nto count records in a list\nto calculate the average or\nto find the maximum or minimum value\n\nTask 7.3 Calculate the average mark for each subject\n1.\n\nEnsure that the cursor is within a cell containing a number in the\nPivotTable, and the context sensitive PivotTable Tools,\nAnalyse tab is activated. Click on Field Settings from the\nActive Field group.\n\n2.\n\nChoose Average as the type of calculation that you want use\nand click ok.\n\nNotice that the PivotTable now displays the average mark for each\nsubject.\n3.\n\nHighlight the numeric cells in the Pivot Table and\nformat the data to 2 decimal places. (Home tab,\nformat, format cells, number).\n\n4.\n\nClick the down arrow to the right of Semester (All) and select\nSemester 1 to see Semester 1\u2019s average marks.\n\n5.\n\nSave the changes and close the file.\n\n\uf0a4Note: Formulas for calculated fields operate on the underlying data.\n\nWhen updating\ndata you must always update the underlying data table, not the data in the Pivot Table.\n\nGrouping data\nA useful feature of PivotTables is the ability to group data. You can move the fields into\nposition in the lower half of the PivotTable Field list to arrange rows into groups and subgroups.\n\nTask 7.4 Grouping data in PivotTables\nIn this example we shall group the PivotTable data by moving\nsemester from the filters box to the rows box.\n1.\n\nOpen the file PivotTable Groupings\n\n2.\n\nIn the boxes below the field list drag Semesters from the\nfilters box to just below Student in the rows box.\n\n3.\n\nObserve the PivotTable. You can now see the student marks for both semesters.\n\n4.\n\nClick on the box to the left of any student name to hide the sub-group data. Click\nto show the detail again.\n\n21\n\n\fPivotTable Slicers\nSlicers are graphic objects containing a set of buttons that enable you to quickly filter the\ndata in a PivotTable report. They provide another way of filtering in PivotTables without\nthe need to open drop-down lists.\nSlicers clearly label the filter that is applied and provide details so that you can\nunderstand the data displayed in the filtered PivotTable report.\n\nTask 7.5 Creating Slicers\n1.\n\nUsing the file PivotTable Groupings ensure your cursor is\nwithin the PivotTable, go to the Insert tab and click Slicer (in the\nFilter group)\n\n2.\n\nFrom the lnsert Slicers dialog box that appears tick School\nand click ok\n\n3.\n\nTo view filtered results using the slicer, click on each school in turn (ACE, HCA,\nLLC and SCI) in the slicer dialog box. Notice how the filtered results in the\nPivotTable change according to the school chosen.\n\n4.\n\nRemove the filter by clicking the remove filter symbol.\n\n5.\n\nSave and close the file.\nTip: To make sections of your PivotTable report more prominent, you can click in the\ntable and use the PivotTable Tools, Design tab on the ribbon to format the design.\n\nCourse Conclusion\nWe hope that you found this course useful.\nTip: You can take what you\u2019ve learned today and think about how to apply it to\nyour work or studies.

understand how to get started with PowerPoint 2010. We will\nunderstand how to start PowerPoint 2010 application in simple steps. To access PowerPoint\n2010, you must have Microsoft Office 2010 installed in your PC. Only Office 2010 Home\nand Student, Home and Business, Standard, Professional and Professional Plus packages\nhave PowerPoint included in them. Other packages may have a viewer, but you cannot\ncreate presentations with them.\nStep 1: Click the Start button.\n\n1\n\n\fPowerPoint 2010\nStep 2: Click All Programs option from the menu.\n\nStep 3: Search for Microsoft Office from the sub menu and click it.\n\n2\n\n\fPowerPoint 2010\nStep 4: Search for Microsoft PowerPoint 2010 from the submenu and click it.\n\nThis will launch the Microsoft PowerPoint 2010 application and you will see the following\npresentation window.\n\n3\n\n\fPowerPoint 2010\n\nPowerPoint 2010 \u2500 Exploring Windows\n\nThe following screenshot shows the various areas in a standard PowerPoint file. It is\nimportant to familiarize yourself with these areas as it makes learning and using\nPowerPoint easier.\n\n4\n\n\fPowerPoint 2010\n\nFile Tab\nThis tab opens the Backstage view which basically allows you to manage the file and\nsettings in PowerPoint. You can save presentations, open existing ones and create new\npresentations based on blank or predefined templates. The other file related operations\ncan also be executed from this view.\n\nRibbon\n\nThe ribbon contains three components:\n\uf0b7\n\nTabs: They appear across the top of the Ribbon and contain groups of related\ncommands. Home, Insert, Page Layout are examples of ribbon tabs.\n\n\uf0b7\n\nGroups: They organize related commands; each group name appears below the\ngroup on the Ribbon. For example, a group of commands related to fonts or a group\nof commands related to alignment, etc.\n\n\uf0b7\n\nCommands: Commands appear within each group as mentioned above.\n\nTitle Bar\nThis is the top section of the window. It shows the name of the file followed by the name\nof the program which in this case is Microsoft PowerPoint.\n\nSlide Area\nThis is the area where the actual slide is created and edited. You can add, edit and delete\ntext, images, shapes and multimedia in this section.\n\n5\n\n\fPowerPoint 2010\n\nHelp\nThe Help Icon can be used to get PowerPoint related help anytime you need. Clicking on\nthe \"?\" opens the PowerPoint Help window where you have a list of common topics to\nbrowse from. You can also search for specific topics from the search bar at the top.\n\nZoom Options\nThe zoom control lets you zoom in for a closer look at your text. The zoom control consists\nof a slider that you can slide left or right to zoom in or out, you can click on the - and +\nbuttons to increase or decrease the zoom factor. The maximum zoom supported by\nPowerPoint is 400% and the 100% is indicated by the mark in the middle.\n\n6\n\n\fPowerPoint 2010\n\nSlide Views\nThe group of four buttons located to the left of the Zoom control, near the bottom of the\nscreen, lets you switch between PowerPoint views.\n\uf0b7\n\nNormal Layout view: This displays page in normal view with the slide on the right\nand a list of thumbnails to the left. This view allows you to edit individual slides and\nalso rearrange them.\n\n\uf0b7\n\nSlide Sorter view: This displays all the slides as a matrix. This view only allows\nyou to rearrange the slides but not edit the contents of each slide.\n\n\uf0b7\n\nReading View: This view is like a slideshow with access to the Windows task bar\nin case you need to switch windows. However, like the slideshow you cannot edit\nanything in this view.\n\nNotes Section\nThis sections allows you to add notes for the presentation. These notes will not be\ndisplayed on the screen during the presentation; these are just quick reference for the\npresenter.\n\nQuick Access Toolbar\nThe Quick Access Toolbar is located just under the ribbon. This toolbar offers a convenient\nplace to group the most commonly used commands in PowerPoint. You can customize this\ntoolbar to suit your needs.\n\nSlide Tab\nThis section is available only in the Normal view. It displays all the slides in sequence. You\ncan add, delete and reorder slides from this section.\n\n7\n\n\fPowerPoint 2010\n\nPowerPoint 2010 - Backstage View\n\nIn Office 2010, Microsoft replaced the traditional file menu with the new Backstage view.\nThis view not only offers all the menu items under the file menu, but additional details\nwhich makes management of your files a lot easier.\n\nAccessing Backstage View\nYou can access the Backstage view simply by clicking on the File tab. You can exit this\nview by clicking on any tab (including the File tab again). You can also press the 'Esc'\nbutton on the keyboard.\n\n8\n\n\fPowerPoint 2010\n\nOrganization of Backstage View\nThe backstage view has three sections or panes.\n\n\uf0b7\n\nFirst Pane: This is the commands pane which consists of all the commands you would\ntypically find in the file menu of older versions. You also have the Options menu which\nlets you edit the options on the program like customizing the ribbon.\n\nVarious commands under the first pane are described in the table below:\nCommand\n\nDescription\n\nSave\n\nThis allows you to save a new file or an existing file in\nstandard format. If you are working on a previously saved\nfile this will save the new changes in the same file format. If\n\n9\n\n\fPowerPoint 2010\n\nyou are working on a new file, this command would be similar\nto the Save As command.\nSave As\n\nAllows you to specify the file name and the file type before\nsaving the file.\n\nOpen\n\nAllows you to open new PowerPoint files.\n\nClose\n\nAllows you to close an existing file.\n\nInfo\nRecent\n\nDisplays the information about the current file.\nLists series of recently viewed or edited PowerPoint files.\n\nNew\n\nAllows you to create a new file using blank or pre-defined\ntemplates.\n\nPrint\n\nAllows you to select the printer settings and print the\npresentation.\n\nSave & Send\n\nAllows you to share your presentation with larger audience\nvia emails, web, cloud services, etc.\n\nHelp\nOptions\n\nExit\n\nProvides access to PowerPoint Help.\nAllows you to set various options related to PowerPoint\nprogram.\nCloses the presentation and exits the program.\n\n\uf0b7\n\nSecond Pane: This is the subcommands pane. This will list all the commands\nrelated to the main command you choose in the first pane. For example, if you\nselect Print in the first pane, you get to choose the printer and adjust the print\nsettings in the second pane.\n\n\uf0b7\n\nThird Pane: This is the preview or file information page. Depending on the\ncommand and the subcommand you select, this pane will either display the\nproperties of the file or give you a preview of the file.\n\n10\n\n\fPowerPoint 2010\n\nPowerPoint 2010 \u2500 Creating Presentation\n\nPowerPoint offers a host of tools that will aid you in creating a presentation. These tools\nare organized logically into various ribbons in PowerPoint. The table below describes the\nvarious commands you can access from the different menus.\n\n11\n\n\fPowerPoint 2010\n\nMenu Category\n\nRibbon Commands\n\nHome\n\nClipboard functions, manipulating slides, fonts,\nsettings, drawing objects and editing functions\n\nInsert\n\nInsert tables, pictures, images, shapes, charts, special texts,\nmultimedia and symbols\n\nDesign\n\nSlide setup,\nbackground\n\nslide\n\norientation,\n\npresentation\n\nparagraph\n\nthemes\n\nTransitions\n\nCommands related to slide transitions\n\nAnimations\n\nCommands related to animation within the individual slides\n\nSlideshow\n\nCommands related to slideshow set up and previews\n\nand\n\nReview\n\nProofing content, language selection, comments and comparing\npresentations\n\nView\n\nCommands related to presentation views, Master slides, color\nsettings and window arrangements\n\nBesides these depending on the objects selected in the slide, there are other menu tabs\nthat get enabled.\n\n12\n\n\fPowerPoint 2010\n\nPowerPoint 2010 \u2500 Adding New Slides\n\nIn this chapter, we will understand how to add new slides in an existing presentation. Here\nare the steps that allow you to insert a new slide in the deck:\nStep 1: Right-click in the Navigation Pane under any existing slide and click on the New\nSlide option.\n\n13\n\n\fPowerPoint 2010\nStep 2: The new slide is inserted. You can now change the layout of this slide to suit your\ndesign requirements.\n\nStep 3: To change the slide layout, right-click on the newly inserted slide and go to the\nLayout option where you can choose from the existing layout styles available to you.\n\n14\n\n\fPowerPoint 2010\n\nYou can follow the same steps to insert a new slide in between existing slides or at the\nend on the slide list.\nWhen we insert a new slide, it inherits the layout of its previous slide with one exception.\nIf you are inserting a new slide after the first slide (Title slide), the subsequent slide will\nhave the Title and Content layout.\nYou will also notice that if you right-click in the first step without selecting any slide the\nmenu options you get are different, although you can insert a new slide from this menu\ntoo.\n\n15\n\n\fPowerPoint 2010\n\n16\n\n\fPowerPoint 2010\n\nPowerPoint 2010 \u2500 Adding Text in Boxes\n\nPowerPoint allows users to add text to the slide in a well-defined manner to ensure the\ncontent is well distributed and easy to read. The procedure to add the text in a PowerPoint\nslide is always the same - just click in the text box and start typing. The text will follow\nthe default formatting set for the text box, although this formatting can be changed later\nas required. What changes is the different kinds of content boxes that support text in a\nPowerPoint slide.\nGiven below are some of the most common content blocks you will see in PowerPoint.\n\nTitle Box\nThis is typically found on slides with the title layout and in all the slides that have a title\nbox in them. This box is indicated by \"Click to add title\".\n\n17\n\n\fPowerPoint 2010\n\nSubtitle Box\nThis is found only in slides with the Title layout. This is indicated by \"Click to add\nsubtitle\".\n\nContent Box\nThis is found in most of the slides that have a placeholder for adding content. This is\nindicated by \"Click to add text\". As you can see, this box allows you to add text as well\nas non-text content. To add text to such a box, click anywhere on the box, except on one\nof the content icons in the center and start typing.\n\n18\n\n\fPowerPoint 2010\n\nText Only Box\nThis is not a default content box available in PowerPoint, but you can create it using Slide\nMaster, if required. This is also indicated by \"Click to add text\". The only difference\nbetween the Text Only Box and the Content Box is that the former only supports text\nin the content area.\n\n19\n\n\fPowerPoint 2010\n\nPowerPoint 2010 \u2500 Adding New Text Boxes\n\nThis chapter will teach you how to add new text boxes in a slide. Most of the standard\nlayouts come with the text box option. As mentioned in the previous chapter, text boxes\nwill have \"Click to add text\" as the default text. Here are the steps to add new text boxes\nin slide.\nStep 1: Click on the Text Box icon in the Home ribbon under the Drawing section.\n\n20\n\n\fPowerPoint 2010\nStep 2: You will get the insert text box cursor that looks like an inverted cross.\nStep 3: Click to insert a text box. You can now start typing directly into the text box.\n\n21\n\n\fPowerPoint 2010\n\nStep 4: Alternately, you can click and drag the cursor without releasing the click to\ncreate a text box.\n\n22\n\n\fPowerPoint 2010\nThe size of the text box can be adjusted by selecting one of the edges marked by squares\nor corners marked by circles.\n\n23\n\n\fPowerPoint 2010\n\nPowerPoint 2010 \u2500 Deleting Existing Slide\n\nThere are times while building a slide deck, you may need to delete some slides. This can\nbe done easily from PowerPoint. You can delete the slides from the Normal view as well\nas the Slide Sorter view. In each view, you can delete the slides in two ways.\n\nDeleting from Normal View\nStep 1: Go to the Normal view.\n\n24\n\n\fPowerPoint 2010\nStep 2: Right-click on the slide to be deleted and select the Delete Slide option.\n\nAlternately, you can select the slide and press the Delete button on your key board.\n\n25\n\n\fPowerPoint 2010\n\nDeleting from Slide Sorter View\nLet us now understand how to deleted slides from the Slide Sorter View.\nStep 1: Go to the Slide Sorter view.\n\n26\n\n\fPowerPoint 2010\nStep 2: Right-click on the slide to be deleted and select the Delete Slide option.\n\nAlternately, you can select the slide and press the Delete button on your key board.\n\n27\n\n\fPowerPoint 2010\n\nPowerPoint 2010 \u2500 Rearranging Slides\n\nRearranging slides is important when it comes to organizing the overall presentation flow.\nWhile it is vital that you get the right content in every slide, it is equally important that\nyou are able to present them in a format that makes it easier for the audience to\nunderstand the content too; most times this will require rearranging the slides.\nYou can rearrange slides from two views in PowerPoint - Normal View and Slide Sorter\nView. Given below are the steps to rearrange slides from different views.\n\nNormal View\nStep 1: Select the slide to be moved\nStep 2: Left click on the slide and drag it to the position in the sequence where you want\nto place it. PowerPoint will indicate the insert position with a line in-between existing slides.\n\n28\n\n\fPowerPoint 2010\nStep 3: When you get to the right position release the left click button to insert the slide.\nAlternately you can also cut the selected slide and paste it back in the sequence as shown\nbelow.\n\n29\n\n\fPowerPoint 2010\n\nSlide Sorter View\nLet us now understand how the Slide Sorter View works.\nStep 1: Select the slide to be moved.\nStep 2: Left click on the slide and drag it to the position in the sequence where you want\nto place it. PowerPoint will indicate the insert position with a line in-between existing slides.\n\nStep 3: When you get to the right position, release the left click button to insert the slide\nAlternately you can also cut the selected slide and paste it back in the sequence as shown\nbelow.\n\n30\n\n\fPowerPoint 2010\n\n31\n\n\fPowerPoint 2010\nEnd of ebook preview\nIf you liked what you saw\u2026\nBuy it from our store @ https://store.tutorialspoint.com\n\n32\n\n\f", "\fMicrosoft\nPowerPoint 2016\nStep by Step\n\nJoan Lambert\n\n\fPUBLISHED BY\nMicrosoft Press\nA division of Microsoft Corporation\nOne Microsoft Way\nRedmond, Washington 98052-6399\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 by Joan Lambert\nAll rights reserved.

This Step by Step book has been designed so you can read it from the\nbeginning to learn about Microsoft PowerPoint 2016 and then build your skills as you\nlearn to perform increasingly specialized procedures. Or, if you prefer, you can jump\nin wherever you need ready guidance for performing tasks. The how-to steps are\ndelivered crisply and concisely\u2014just the facts. You\u2019ll also find informative, full-color\ngraphics that support the instructional content.\n\nWho this book is for\nMicrosoft PowerPoint 2016 Step by Step is designed for use as a learning and reference\nresource by home and business users of Microsoft Office programs who want to use\nPowerPoint to create and present slide presentations and printed materials. The content\nof the book is designed to be useful for people who have previously used earlier versions of PowerPoint and for people who are discovering PowerPoint for the first time.\n\nThe Step by Step approach\nThe book\u2019s coverage is divided into parts representing general PowerPoint skill sets.\nEach part is divided into chapters representing skill set areas, and each chapter is\ndivided into topics that group related skills. Each topic includes expository information followed by generic procedures. At the end of the chapter, you\u2019ll find a series of\npractice tasks you can complete on your own by using the skills taught in the chapter. You can use the practice files that are available from this book\u2019s website to work\nthrough the practice tasks, or you can use your own files.\n\nxi\n\n\fIntroduction\n\nDownload the practice files\nBefore you can complete the practice tasks in this book, you need to download\nthe book\u2019s practice files to your computer from http://aka.ms/powerpoint2016sbs\n/downloads. Follow the instructions on the webpage.\nIMPORTANT PowerPoint 2016 is not available from the book\u2019s website. You should\ninstall that app before working through the procedures and practice tasks in this book.\n\nYou can open the files that are supplied for the practice tasks and save the finished\nversions of each file. If you later want to repeat practice tasks, you can download the\noriginal practice files again.\nSEE ALSO For information about opening and saving files, see \u201cOpen and navigate\npresentations\u201d in Chapter 2, \u201cCreate and manage presentations.\u201d\n\nThe following table lists the practice files for this book.\nChapter\n\nFolder\n\nFile\n\nPart 1: Get started with PowerPoint 2016\n1: PowerPoint 2016 basics\n\nCh01\n\nNone\n\n2: Create and manage presentations\n\nCh02\n\nNavigateSlides.pptx\n\n3: Create and manage slides\n\nCh03\n\nAddRemoveSlides.pptx\nApplyThemes.pptx\nChangeBackgrounds.pptx\nCreateSections.pptx\nImportOutline.docx\nRearrangeSlides.pptx\nReuseSlides.pptx\n\nxii\n\n\fIntroduction\n\nChapter\n\nFolder\n\nFile\n\nCh04\n\nApplyTextEffects.pptx\n\nPart 2: Insert and manage slide text\n4: Enter and edit text on slides\n\nCheckSpelling.pptx\nEditText.pptx\nEnterText.pptx\nFormatText.pptx\n5: Present text in tables\n\nCh05\n\nFormatTables.pptx\nInsertTables.pptx\nLinkTables.pptx\nModifyTables.pptx\nNewEquipment.xlsx\n\nPart 3: Insert and manage visual elements\n6: Insert and manage simple graphics\n\nCh06\n\nChickens.jpg\nDrawShapes.pptx\nEditPictures.pptx\nFish.jpg\nFlamingos.jpg\nFlowers.jpg\nInsertPictures.pptx\nInsertScreens.pptx\nPenguins01.jpg, Penguins02.jpg\nTiger01.jpg, Tiger02.jpg\nYellowBird.jpg\n\nxiii\n\n\fIntroduction\n\nChapter\n\nFolder\n\nFile\n\n7: Create and manage business graphics\n\nCh07\n\nCreateCharts.pptx\nCreateDiagrams.pptx\nFlowers01.jpg \u2013 Flowers03.jpg\nFormatCharts.pptx\nFormatDiagrams.pptx\nModifyCharts.pptx\nModifyDiagrams.pptx\nTemperatures.xlsx\n\n8: Add sound and movement to slides\n\nCh08\n\nAddAudio.pptx\nAddTransitions.pptx\nAddVideo.pptx\nAnimateSlides.pptx\nButterfly.wmv\nCustomizeAnimations.pptx\nSoundTrack.wma\nWildlife.wmv\n\nPart 4: Finalize presentations\n9: Review presentations\n\nCh09\n\nAddNotes.pptx\nConfigureSlides.pptx\nInspectPresentations.pptx\nPrintSlides.pptx\nYinYang.png\n\n10: Prepare and deliver presentations\n\nCh10\n\nAdaptPresentations.pptx\nApplyTimings.pptx\nDeliverPresentations.pptx\n\nxiv\n\n\fIntroduction\n\nChapter\n\nFolder\n\nFile\n\nPart 5: Use advanced PowerPoint functions\n11: Work in PowerPoint more efficiently\n\nCh11\n\nNone\n\n12: Create custom presentation\nelements\n\nCh12\n\nBackground.jpg\nCreateThemes.pptx\nCustomizeMasters.pptx\nSaveTemplates.pptx\n\n13: Save and share presentations\n\nCh13\n\nAddComments.pptx\nRestrictAccess.pptx\nSaveSlides.pptx\nShareSlides.pptx\n\nEbook edition\nIf you're reading the ebook edition of this book, you can do the following:\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nSearch the full text\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nPrint\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nCopy and paste\n\nYou can purchase and download the ebook edition from the Microsoft Press Store at\nhttp://aka.ms/powerpoint2016sbs/detail.\n\nGet support and give feedback\nThis topic provides information about getting help with this book and contacting us\nto provide feedback or report errors.\n\nErrata and support\nWe\u2019ve made every effort to ensure the accuracy of this book and its companion content.

You can also use PowerPoint to quite\neasily lay out complex single-page presentations for\nproduction as flyers, posters, or postcards, or for delivery\nas electronic files, such as pictures.\nPowerPoint presentations can be an effective way of\nproviding information in small segments. Individual slides\ncan include bullet points, pictures, charts, tables, and\nbusiness diagrams. Professionally designed themes visually enhance your message and provide a professional,\ncoordinated appearance.\n\nIn this chapter\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nStart PowerPoint\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nWork in the PowerPoint user\ninterface\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nManage Office and app settings\n\nPractice files\nNo practice files are necessary to\ncomplete the practice tasks in this\nchapter.\n\nThe elements that control the appearance of PowerPoint\nand the way you interact with it while you create presentations are collectively referred to as the user interface.\nSome user interface elements, such as the color scheme,\nare cosmetic. Others, such as toolbars, menus, and buttons, are functional. The default PowerPoint configuration\nand functionality is based on the way that most people\nwork with the app. You can modify cosmetic and functional user interface elements to suit your preferences and\nworking style.\nThis chapter guides you through procedures related to\nstarting PowerPoint, working in the PowerPoint user\ninterface, and managing Office and app settings.\n3\n\n\fChapter 1: PowerPoint 2016 basics\n\nStart PowerPoint\nThe way that you start PowerPoint 2016 is dependent on the operating system you\u2019re\nrunning on your computer. For example:\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nIn Windows 10, you can start PowerPoint from the Start menu, the All Apps\nmenu, the Start screen, or the taskbar search box.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nIn Windows 8, you can start PowerPoint from the Apps screen or Start screen\nsearch results.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nIn Windows 7, you can start PowerPoint from the Start menu, All Programs\nmenu, or Start menu search results.\n\nYou might also have a shortcut to PowerPoint on your desktop or on the Windows\ntaskbar.\nWhen you start PowerPoint without opening a specific presentation, the PowerPoint\nStart screen appears. The Start screen is a hybrid of the Open and New pages of the\nBackstage view. It displays links to recent files in the left pane, and new file templates\nin the right pane.\nTIP You can turn off the appearance of the Start screen if you want to go directly to a\nnew, blank presentation. For information, see \u201cChange default PowerPoint options\u201d in\nChapter 11, \u201cWork in PowerPoint more efficiently.\u201d\n\nTo start PowerPoint by opening a presentation\n1. Do either of the following:\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\nIn File Explorer, double-click the presentation.\nTIP File Explorer is the current version of the browsing utility that was\nformerly known as Windows Explorer. If you\u2019re working on a Windows 7\ncomputer, use Windows Explorer whenever this book refers to File Explorer.\n\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\nIn Microsoft Outlook, double-click a presentation that is attached to an\nemail message.\nTIP By default, PowerPoint opens presentations from online sources in\nprotected mode.\n\n4\n\n\fWork in the PowerPoint user interface\n\nTo start PowerPoint on a Windows 10 computer\n1. Click the Start button, and then click All apps.\n\n1\n\n2. In the app list, click any index letter to display the alphabet index, and then click\nP to scroll the app list to the apps starting with that letter.\n3. Scroll the list if necessary, and then click PowerPoint 2016 to start the app.\nTo start PowerPoint on a Windows 8 computer\n1. From the Start screen, display the Apps screen.\n2. Sort the Apps screen by name, and then click any index letter to display the\nalphabet index.\n3. In the alphabet index, click P to scroll the app list to the apps starting with that\nletter. Then click PowerPoint 2016 to start the app.\n\nWork in the PowerPoint user interface\nThe PowerPoint user interface provides intuitive access to all the tools you need to\ndevelop a sophisticated presentation tailored to the needs of your audience. You can\nuse PowerPoint 2016 to do the following (and much more):\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nCreate, import, format, and edit slide content, including text, pictures, tables,\ncharts, shapes, symbols, equations, SmartArt business diagrams, audio recordings, and video recordings.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nCapture screenshots, screen recordings, and audio recordings.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nOrganize and manage slides in sections.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nAnimate slide content and the transitions between slides; managing the form,\ntiming, and sound associated with animations.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nDocument speaker notes for each slide.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nControl the layout of content by creating custom masters; precisely align slide\nelements by using gridlines and Smart Guides.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nCreate, rehearse, present, and record custom slide shows.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nSave, export, and send presentations in a wide variety of formats.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nCreate notes in a OneNote notebook that link to specific slide content.\n5\n\n\fChapter 1: PowerPoint 2016 basics\n\nWhen you\u2019re working with a presentation, it is displayed in an app window that contains all the tools you need to add and format content.\n\nA presentation displayed in the app window\n\nAbout Office\nPowerPoint 2016 is part of the Microsoft Office 2016 suite of apps, which also\nincludes Microsoft Access, Excel, Outlook, and Word. The apps in the Office\nsuite are designed to work together to provide highly efficient methods of\ngetting things done. You can install one or more Office apps on your computer. Some apps have multiple versions designed for different platforms. For\nexample, you can install different versions of PowerPoint on a computer, a\nsmartphone, an iPad, and an Android device; you can also work in a version\nof PowerPoint that is hosted entirely online. Although the core purpose of an\napp remains the same regardless of the platform on which it runs, the available functionality and the way you interact with the app might be different.\n\n6\n\n\fWork in the PowerPoint user interface\n\nThe app that is described and depicted in images throughout this book is a\nstandard desktop installation of PowerPoint 2016 on a Windows 10 computer.\nIt is available as part of the Office 2016 suite of apps, as a freestanding app, or\nas part of an Office 365 subscription.\n\n1\n\nUntil recently, the standard way of acquiring Office software was to purchase\na disc, packaged in a box, and install the software from the disc. In the recent\npast, the standard distribution model has changed to an online installation,\noften as part of an Office 365 subscription licensing package.\nOffice 365, which was originally available only to businesses, now has many\nsubscription options designed for individual home and business users,\nstudents, households, small businesses, midsize businesses, enterprises,\ngovernment agencies, academic institutions, and nonprofits; in other words,\nwhatever your needs may be, there is an Office 365 subscription option that\nwill be a close fit. Many of the Office 365 subscription options include licensing for the desktop Office apps and permit users to run Office on multiple\ndevices, including Windows computers, Mac computers, Windows tablets,\nAndroid tablets, iPads, and smartphones.\nIf you have an Office 365 subscription and are working on a presentation that\nis stored on a Microsoft SharePoint site or in a Microsoft OneDrive folder,\nyou\u2019ll also have access to PowerPoint Online. You can review and edit presentations in PowerPoint Online, which runs directly in your browser instead of\non your computer. Office Online apps are installed in the online environment\nin which you\u2019re working and are not part of the desktop version that you\ninstall directly on your computer.\nSEE ALSO For information about connecting to OneDrive and SharePoint\nsites, see \u201cManage Office and app settings\u201d later in this chapter.\nPowerPoint Online displays the contents of a presentation very much like the\ndesktop app does, and offers a limited subset of the commands and content\nformatting options that are available in the full desktop app. If you\u2019re working with a presentation in PowerPoint Online and find that you need more\nfunctionality than is available, and you have the full version of PowerPoint\ninstalled on your computer, you can open the presentation in the full version.\n\n7\n\n\fChapter 1: PowerPoint 2016 basics\n\nIdentify app window elements\nThe PowerPoint app window contains the elements described in this section. Commands for tasks you perform often are readily available, and even those you might\nuse infrequently are easy to find.\n\nTitle bar\nAt the top of the app window, this bar displays the name of the active file, identifies\nthe app, and provides tools for managing the app window, ribbon, and content.\n\nThe title bar elements are always on the left end, in the center, and on the right end of the title bar\n\nThe Quick Access Toolbar at the left end of the title bar can be customized to include\nany commands that you want to have easily available. The default Quick Access Toolbar in the PowerPoint app window displays the Save, Undo, Redo/Repeat, and Start\nFrom Beginning buttons. On a touchscreen device, the default Quick Access Toolbar\nalso includes the Touch/Mouse Mode button.\nSEE ALSO For information about Touch mode, see \u201cWork with the ribbon and status\nbar\u201d later in this topic.\n\nYou can change the location of the Quick Access Toolbar and customize it to include\nany command to which you want to have easy access.\nTIP You might find that you work more efficiently if you organize the commands you\nuse frequently on the Quick Access Toolbar and then display it below the ribbon, directly\nabove the workspace. For information, see \u201cCustomize the Quick Access Toolbar\u201d in Chapter 11,\n\u201cWork in PowerPoint more efficiently.\u201d\n\nFour buttons at the right end of the title bar serve the same functions in all Office\napps. You control the display of the ribbon by clicking commands on the Ribbon\n\n8\n\n\fWork in the PowerPoint user interface\n\nDisplay Options menu, temporarily hide the app window by clicking the Minimize\nbutton, adjust the size of the window by clicking the Restore Down/Maximize button,\nand close the active presentation or exit the app by clicking the Close button.\n\n1\n\nSEE ALSO For information about different methods of closing presentations and\nexiting PowerPoint, see \u201cSave and close presentations\u201d in Chapter 2, \u201cCreate and\nmanage presentations.\u201d\n\nRibbon\nThe ribbon is located below the title bar. The commands you\u2019ll use when working with\na presentation are gathered together in this central location for efficiency.\n\nYour ribbon might display additional tabs\n\nTIP The available ribbon tabs and the appearance of the commands on the ribbon\nmight differ from what is shown in this book, based on the apps that are installed on\nyour computer, the PowerPoint settings and window size, and the screen settings. For more\ninformation, see the sidebar \u201cAdapt procedure steps\u201d later in this chapter.\n\nAcross the top of the ribbon is a set of tabs. Clicking a tab displays an associated set of\ncommands arranged in groups.\nCommands related to managing PowerPoint and presentations (rather than presentation content) are gathered together in the Backstage view, which you display by\nclicking the File tab located at the left end of the ribbon. Commands available in the\nBackstage view are organized on named pages, which you display by clicking the\npage tabs in the colored left pane. You redisplay the presentation and the ribbon by\nclicking the Back arrow located above the page tabs.\n\n9\n\n\fChapter 1: PowerPoint 2016 basics\n\nYou manage files and app settings in the Backstage view\n\nCommands related to working with presentation content are represented as buttons\non the remaining tabs of the ribbon. The Home tab, which is active by default, contains the most frequently used commands.\nWhen a graphic element such as a picture, table, or chart is selected on a slide, one\nor more tool tabs might appear at the right end of the ribbon to make commands\nrelated to that specific object easily accessible. Tool tabs are available only when the\nrelevant object is selected.\nTIP Some older commands no longer appear as buttons on the ribbon but are still\navailable in the app. You can make these commands available by adding them to the\nQuick Access Toolbar or the ribbon. For more information, see \u201cCustomize the Quick Access\nToolbar\u201d and \u201cCustomize the ribbon\u201d in Chapter 11, \u201cWork in PowerPoint more efficiently.\u201d\n\nOn each tab, buttons representing commands are organized into named groups. You\ncan point to any button to display a ScreenTip that contains the command name, a\ndescription of its function, and its keyboard shortcut (if it has one).\n10\n\n\fWork in the PowerPoint user interface\n\n1\n\nScreenTips can include the command name, keyboard shortcut, and description\n\nTIP You can control the display of ScreenTips and of feature descriptions in ScreenTips.\nFor more information, see \u201cChange default PowerPoint options\u201d in Chapter 11, \u201cWork in\nPowerPoint more efficiently.\u201d\n\nSome buttons include an arrow, which might be integrated with or separate from\nthe button. To determine whether a button and its arrow are integrated, point to the\nbutton to activate it. If both the button and its arrow are shaded, clicking the button\ndisplays options for refining the action of the button. If only the button or arrow\nis shaded when you point to it, clicking the button carries out its default action or\napplies the current default formatting. Clicking the arrow and then clicking an action\ncarries out the action. Clicking the arrow and then clicking a formatting option applies\nthe formatting and sets it as the default for the button.\n\nExamples of buttons with separate and integrated arrows\n\nWhen a formatting option has several choices available, they are often displayed in\na gallery of images, called thumbnails, that provide a visual representation of each\nchoice. When you point to a thumbnail in a gallery, the Live Preview feature shows\nyou what the active content will look like if you click the thumbnail to apply the associated formatting. When a gallery contains more thumbnails than can be shown in the\navailable ribbon space, you can display more content by clicking the scroll arrow or\nMore button located on the right border of the gallery.\n11\n\n\fChapter 1: PowerPoint 2016 basics\n\nRelated but less common commands are not represented as buttons in a group.\nInstead, they\u2019re available in a dialog box or pane, which you display by clicking the\ndialog box launcher located in the lower-right corner of the group.\nTIP To the right of the groups on the ribbon is the Collapse The Ribbon button, which is\nshaped like a chevron. For more information, see \u201cWork with the ribbon and status bar,\u201d\nlater in this topic.\n\nTell me what you want to do\nEntering a term in the Tell Me What You Want To Do box located to the right\nof the ribbon tabs displays a list of related commands and links to additional\nresources online. Or you can press F1 to open the Help window for the current app.\n\nThe easy path to help when working in PowerPoint\n\nStatus bar\nAcross the bottom of the app window, the status bar displays information about the\ncurrent presentation and provides access to certain PowerPoint functions. You can\n\n12\n\n\fWork in the PowerPoint user interface\n\nchoose which statistics and tools appear on the status bar. Some items, such as Document Updates Available, appear on the status bar only when that condition is true.\n\n1\n\nYou can specify which items you want to display on the status bar\n\nSEE ALSO For information about displaying updates when coauthoring a PowerPoint\npresentation, see \u201cCoauthor presentations\u201d in Chapter 13, \u201cSave and share presentations.\u201d\n\nThe Notes and Comments buttons, View Shortcuts toolbar, Zoom Slider tool, and\nZoom button are at the right end of the status bar. These tools provide you with convenient methods for changing the display of presentation content.\n\nYou can display and hide content, display different content views, and change the magnification from the\nstatus bar\n\nSEE ALSO For information about changing the content view, see \u201cDisplay different\nviews of presentations\u201d in Chapter 2, \u201cCreate and manage presentations.\u201d For information about entering notes, see \u201cAdd notes to slides\u201d in Chapter 9, \u201cReview presentations.\u201d For\ninformation about entering comments, see \u201cAdd and review comments\u201d in Chapter 13, \u201cSave\nand share presentations.\u201d\n\n13\n\n\fChapter 1: PowerPoint 2016 basics\n\nWork with the ribbon and status bar\nThe goal of the ribbon is to make working with presentation content as intuitive as\npossible. The ribbon is dynamic, meaning that as its width changes, its buttons adapt\nto the available space. As a result, a button might be large or small, it might or might\nnot have a label, or it might even change to an entry in a list.\nFor example, when sufficient horizontal space is available, the buttons on the View\ntab of the PowerPoint app window are spread out, and you can review the commands\navailable in each group.\n\nAt 1024 pixels wide, most button labels are visible\n\nIf you decrease the horizontal space available to the ribbon, small button labels disappear and entire groups of buttons might hide under one button that represents the\nentire group. Clicking the group button displays a list of the commands available in\nthat group.\n\nWhen insufficient horizontal space is available, labels disappear and groups collapse under buttons\n\nWhen the ribbon becomes too narrow to display all the groups, a scroll arrow appears\nat its right end. Clicking the scroll arrow displays the hidden groups.\n\nScroll to display additional group buttons\n\n14\n\n\fWork in the PowerPoint user interface\n\nThe width of the ribbon depends on these three factors:\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nWindow width Maximizing the app window provides the most space for the\nribbon.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nScreen resolution creen resolution is the size of your screen display expressed\nas pixels wide \u00d7 pixels high. The greater the screen resolution, the greater\nthe amount of information that will fit on one screen. Your screen resolution\noptions are dependent on the display adapter installed in your computer,\nand on your monitor. Common screen resolutions range from 800 \u00d7 600 to\n2560 \u00d7 1440 (and some are larger). The greater the number of pixels wide (the\nfirst number), the greater the number of buttons that can be shown on the\nribbon.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nThe magnification of your screen display If you change the screen magnification setting in Windows, text and user interface elements are larger and\ntherefore more legible, but fewer elements fit on the screen.\n\n1\n\nYou can hide the ribbon completely if you don\u2019t need access to any of its buttons, or\nhide it so that only its tabs are visible. (This is a good way to gain vertical space when\nworking on a smaller screen.) Then you can temporarily redisplay the ribbon to click a\nbutton, or permanently redisplay it if you need to click several buttons.\nIf you\u2019re working on a touchscreen device, you can turn on Touch mode, which provides more space between buttons on the ribbon and status bar. (It doesn\u2019t affect the\nlayout of dialog boxes or panes.) The extra space is intended to lessen the possibility\nof accidentally tapping the wrong button with your finger.\n\nTouch mode has a greater amount of space on the ribbon and status bar\n\nThe same commands are available in Touch mode, but they\u2019re often hidden under\ngroup buttons.\nSEE ALSO For information about working with a modified ribbon, see the sidebar\n\u201cAdapt procedure steps\u201d later in this topic.\n\n15\n\n\fChapter 1: PowerPoint 2016 basics\n\nYou can switch between Touch mode and Mouse mode (the standard desktop app\nuser interface) from the Quick Access Toolbar. Switching any one of the primary Office\napps (Access, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint, and Word) to Touch mode turns it on in all\nof them.\nTo maximize the app window\n1. Do any of the following:\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\nClick the Maximize button.\n\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\nDouble-click the title bar.\n\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\nDrag the borders of a non-maximized window.\n\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\nDrag the window to the top of the screen. (When the pointer touches the\ntop of the screen, the dragged window maximizes.)\n\nTo change the screen resolution\nTIP Methods of changing screen resolution vary by operating system, but you should\nbe able to access the settings in Windows 10, Windows 8, and Windows 7 by using these\nmethods.\n\n1. Do any of the following:\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\nRight-click the Windows 10 desktop, and then click Display settings. At the\nbottom of the Display pane of the Settings window, click the Advanced\ndisplay settings link.\nRight-click the Windows 8 or Windows 7 desktop, and then click Screen\nresolution.\nEnter screen resolution in Windows Search, and then click Change the\nscreen resolution in the search results.\nOpen the Display Control Panel item, and then click Adjust resolution.\n\n2. Click or drag to select the screen resolution you want, and then click Apply or\nOK. Windows displays a preview of the selected screen resolution.\n3. If you like the change, click Keep changes in the message box that appears. If\nyou don\u2019t, the screen resolution reverts to the previous setting.\n\n16\n\n\fWork in the PowerPoint user interface\n\nTo completely hide the ribbon\n1. Near the right end of the title bar, click the Ribbon Display Options button.\n\n1\n\nThe Ribbon Display Options button is on the title bar so that it is available when the ribbon is hidden\n\n2. On the Ribbon Display Options menu, click Auto-hide Ribbon.\nTIP To redisplay the ribbon, click the Ribbon Display Options button and then click\nShow Tabs or Show Tabs And Commands.\n\nTo display only the ribbon tabs\n1. Do any of the following:\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\nDouble-click any active tab name.\nNear the upper-right corner of the app window, click the Ribbon Display\nOptions button, and then click Show Tabs.\nIn the lower-right corner of the ribbon, click the Collapse the Ribbon\nbutton.\nPress Ctrl+F1.\n\nTo temporarily redisplay the ribbon\n1. Click any tab name to display the tab until you click a command or click away\nfrom the ribbon.\n\n17\n\n\fChapter 1: PowerPoint 2016 basics\n\nTo permanently redisplay the ribbon\n1. Do any of the following:\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\nDouble-click any tab name.\nNear the upper-right corner of the app window, click the Ribbon Display\nOptions button, and then click Show Tabs and Commands.\nPress Ctrl+F1.\n\nTo optimize the ribbon for touch interaction\n1. On the Quick Access Toolbar, click or tap the Touch/Mouse Mode button, and\nthen click Touch.\nTo specify the items that appear on the status bar\n1. Right-click the status bar to display the Customize Status Bar menu. A check\nmark indicates each item that is currently enabled.\n2. Click to enable or disable a status bar indicator or tool. The change is effected\nimmediately. The menu remains open to permit multiple selections.\n3. When you finish, click away from the menu to close it.\n\nAdapt procedure steps\nThis book contains many images of user interface elements (such as the ribbons and the app windows) that you\u2019ll work with while performing tasks in\nPowerPoint on a Windows computer. Depending on your screen resolution\nor app window width, the PowerPoint ribbon on your screen might look different from that shown in this book. (If you turn on Touch mode, the ribbon\ndisplays significantly fewer commands than in Mouse mode.) As a result, procedural instructions that involve the ribbon might require a little adaptation.\nSimple procedural instructions use this format:\n1. On the Insert tab, in the Illustrations group, click the Chart button.\nIf the command is in a list, our instructions use this format:\n1. On the Transitions tab, in the Timing group, click the Sound arrow and\nthen, in the Sound list, click Chime.\n18\n\n\fWork in the PowerPoint user interface\n\nIf differences between your display settings and ours cause a button to\nappear differently on your screen than it does in this book, you can easily\nadapt the steps to locate the command. First click the specified tab, and then\nlocate the specified group. If a group has been collapsed into a group list\nor under a group button, click the list or button to display the group\u2019s commands. If you can\u2019t immediately identify the button you want, point to likely\ncandidates to display their names in ScreenTips.\n\n1\n\nMultistep procedural instructions use this format:\n1. Display the presentation in Normal view.\n2. Select the animated object or objects that you want to modify.\n3. On the Animations tab, in the Timing group, click the Start arrow to\ndisplay the list of start timing options.\n4. In the Start list, click After Previous.\nOn subsequent instances of instructions that require you to follow the same\nprocess, the instructions might be simplified in this format because the working location has already been established:\n1. In Normal view, select the animated objects that you want to modify.\n2. On the Animations tab, in the Start list, click After Previous.\nThe instructions in this book assume that you\u2019re interacting with on-screen\nelements on your computer by clicking (with a mouse, touchpad, or other\nhardware device). If you\u2019re using a different method\u2014for example, if your\ncomputer has a touchscreen interface and you\u2019re tapping the screen (with\nyour finger or a stylus)\u2014substitute the applicable tapping action when you\ninteract with a user interface element.\nInstructions in this book refer to user interface elements that you click or tap\non the screen as buttons, and to physical buttons that you press on a keyboard as keys, to conform to the standard terminology used in documentation for these products.\nWhen the instructions tell you to enter information, you can do so by typing\non a connected external keyboard, tapping an on-screen keyboard, or even\nspeaking aloud, depending on your computer setup and your personal\npreferences.\n19\n\n\fChapter 1: PowerPoint 2016 basics\n\nManage Office and app settings\nYou access app settings from the Backstage view; specifically, from the Account page\nand the PowerPoint Options dialog box.\nThe Account page of the Backstage view in PowerPoint displays information about\nyour installation of PowerPoint (and other apps in the Office suite) and the resources\nyou connect to. This information includes:\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nYour Microsoft account and links to manage it.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nThe current app window background and theme.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nStorage locations and services (such as Facebook and LinkedIn) that you\u2019ve\nconnected Office to.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nYour subscription information and links to manage the subscription, if you have\nOffice through an Office 365 subscription.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nThe app version number and update options.\n\nAccount information in PowerPoint\n\n20\n\n\fManage Office and app settings\n\nMicrosoft account options\n\n1\n\nIf you use Office 365, Skype, OneDrive, Xbox Live, Outlook.com, or a Windows\nPhone, you already have a Microsoft account. (Microsoft account credentials\nare also used by many non-Microsoft products and websites.) If you don\u2019t\nalready have a Microsoft account, you can register any existing account as a\nMicrosoft account, sign up for a free Outlook.com or Hotmail.com account\nand register that as a Microsoft account, or create an alias for an Outlook.com\naccount and register the alias.\nTIP Many apps and websites authenticate transactions by using Microsoft\naccount credentials. For that reason, it\u2019s a good idea to register a personal\naccount that you control, rather than a business account that your employer\ncontrols, as your Microsoft account. That way, you won\u2019t risk losing access if\nyou leave the company.\n\nTwo ways you can personalize the appearance of your PowerPoint app window are by\nchoosing an Office background and an Office theme. (These are specific to Office and\naren\u2019t in any way associated with the Windows theme or desktop background.) The\nbackground is a subtle design that appears in the title bar of the app window. There\nare 14 backgrounds to choose from, or you can choose to not have a background.\n\nBackgrounds depict a variety of subjects\n\n21\n\n\fChapter 1: PowerPoint 2016 basics\n\nAt the time of this writing, there are three Office themes:\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nColorful Displays the title bar and ribbon tabs in the color specific to the app,\nand the ribbon commands, status bar, and Backstage view in light gray\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nDark Gray Displays the title bar and ribbon tabs in dark gray, and the ribbon\ncommands, status bar, and Backstage view in light gray\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nWhite Displays the title bar, ribbon tabs, and ribbon commands in white, and\nthe status bar in the app-specific color\n\nThere are rumors that another theme will be released in the near future, but it hasn\u2019t\nyet made an appearance.\nTIP The images in this book depict the No Background option to avoid interfering with\nthe display of any user interface elements, and the Colorful theme.\n\nFrom the Connected Services area of the page, you can connect Office to Facebook,\nFlickr, and YouTube accounts to access pictures and videos; to SharePoint sites and\n\u00adOneDrive storage locations; and to LinkedIn and Twitter accounts to share presentations. You must already have an account with one of these services to connect Office\nto it.\nUntil you connect to storage locations, they aren\u2019t available to you from within\nPower\u00adPoint. For example, when inserting a picture onto a slide, you will have the\noption to insert a locally stored picture or to search online for a picture. After you\nconnect to your Facebook, SharePoint, and OneDrive accounts, you can also insert\npictures stored in those locations.\nThe changes that you make on the Account page apply to all the Office apps installed\non all the computers associated with your account. For example, changing the Office\nbackground in PowerPoint on one computer also changes it in Outlook on any other\ncomputer on which you\u2019ve associated Office with the same account.\nSome of the settings on the Account page are also available in the PowerPoint\nOptions dialog box, which you open from the Backstage view. This dialog box also\ncontains hundreds of options for controlling the way PowerPoint works. Chapter 11,\n\u201cWork in PowerPoint more efficiently,\u201d provides in-depth coverage of these options.\nIt\u2019s a good idea to familiarize yourself with the dialog box content so you know what\nyou can modify.\n\n22\n\n\fManage Office and app settings\n\nTo display your Office account settings\n1. With PowerPoint running, click the File tab to display the Backstage view.\n\n1\n\n2. In the left pane of the Backstage view, click Account.\nTo manage your Microsoft account settings\n1.

Close the presentation without saving changes.\n\n26\n\n\f2\n\nCreate and\nmanage\npresentations\nPowerPoint makes it easy to efficiently create effective\npresentations for a wide variety of audiences. PowerPoint\npresentations are no longer used solely by business executives to present information at board meetings. They\u2019re\ncommonly used in business and educational settings to\nshare information, not only in group presentations, but\nalso in electronic communications and online settings.\nEven primary school students are assigned PowerPoint\npresentations as homework projects. Whether you need\nto give a report about a research study, present a budget\nto a board of directors, or convince management to invest\nin a new piece of equipment, PowerPoint helps you get\nthe job done in a professional, visually appealing way.\n\nIn this chapter\n\nThe sophisticated presentation features of PowerPoint are\neasy to find and use, so even novice users can work productively with PowerPoint after only a brief introduction.\nMany of the processes you perform with slide content\nare similar to processes you use in Microsoft Word documents and Microsoft Excel workbooks, so if you already\nuse another Microsoft Office app, you might be familiar\nwith them. Processes that are specific to the creation and\nmanagement of slides are unique to PowerPoint.\n\nPractice files\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nCreate presentations\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nOpen and navigate\npresentations\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nDisplay different views of\npresentations\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nDisplay and edit presentation\nproperties\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nSave and close presentations\n\nFor this chapter, use the practice files\nfrom the PowerPoint2016SBS\\Ch02\nfolder.

Unlike the templates provided\nfor Word and Excel, most PowerPoint templates are design templates that control\nthematic elements (colors, fonts, and graphic effects) and slide layouts rather than\ncontent templates that provide purpose-specific placeholder content. Each template has a corresponding theme, so you can create a presentation based on one\ntemplate but then entirely change its appearance by applying a different theme.\nWhen you start PowerPoint, the app displays a Start screen that gives you options for\nopening an existing presentation or creating a new one.\n\nThe Start screen appears by default but can be disabled\n\nIMPORTANT The templates that appear by default in your installation of PowerPoint\nmight be different from those shown in images in this book. The templates can change\ndepending on your use of PowerPoint and the installation of program updates.\n\n28\n\n\fCreate presentations\n\nThere are a few different ways to start a new presentation. If you press the Esc key\nwhen this screen appears, PowerPoint starts a blank presentation for you. You can\nalso select from among the presentation thumbnails and links to create presentations\nbased on the following sources:\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\n2\n\nBlank presentation If you want to build and format a presentation from\nscratch, you can start with a presentation based on the Blank Presentation template. A new, blank presentation contains only a blank title page; it\u2019s up to you\nto add slides and slide content, apply a theme, and make any necessary custom\nconfiguration changes. Creating attractive, functional presentations from\nscratch can be time-consuming and requires quite a bit of knowledge about\nPowerPoint. You\u2019ll learn the skills you need while you work through this book.\nSEE ALSO For information about themes, see \u201cApply themes\u201d in Chapter 3,\n\u201cCreate and manage slides.\u201d\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nDesign template You can save time by basing your presentation on one of\nthe many design templates that come with PowerPoint. A design template is\na blank presentation with a theme already applied to it. Sometimes it includes\nbackground graphic elements and specialized slide layouts. Some templates\nsupply only a title slide and leave it to you to add the other slides you need;\nother templates supply an example of each of the available slide layouts.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nContent template You can preview and download many prepopulated\npresentation templates from the Office website. These templates provide not\nonly the design elements but also suggestions for content that is appropriate\nfor different types of presentations, such as reports or product launches. After\nyou download a template, you simply customize the content provided in the\ntemplate to meet your needs.\n\nAn important thing to be aware of when you create a presentation in PowerPoint\nis that you have the choice of two slide aspect ratios, which are referred to (slightly\n\u00adinaccurately) as slide sizes. The default slide size is Widescreen (16:9), which is optimized for displays such as those found on many laptop screens and desktop monitors\nthese days.\n\n29\n\n\fChapter 2: Create and manage presentations\n\nWidescreen slides are shorter than Standard slides\n\nThe alternative slide size is Standard (4:3), which is optimized for wide rectangular\nscreens such as that of the iPad.\n\nStandard slides fit tablet screens\n\n30\n\n\fCreate presentations\n\nThe actual size (dimensions) of the slide aren\u2019t as important as its aspect ratio. By\ndefault, the slides in presentations you create based on the Blank Presentation template are set to Widescreen size.\n\n2\n\nSEE ALSO For more information about slide sizes, see \u201cConfigure slides for presentation or printing\u201d in Chapter 9, \u201cReview presentations.\u201d\n\nWhen you display the built-in templates on the New page of the Backstage view, the\ndefault slide size of each template is apparent from its thumbnail. Most of the templates are 16:9, but you can easily filter the templates to display only those that are\nformatted specifically for 4:3 slides.\nBefore you begin adding content to a new presentation, you should consider how the\npresentation will be viewed and choose the most appropriate slide size. It\u2019s advisable\nto select the slide size before you select the presentation template. You can change\nthe slide size after you create the slide deck, but doing so might cause graphic elements (especially those on master slides) to look different, and text and other slide\nelements to not fit on slides as intended.\nWhether you create a blank presentation or a presentation that is based on a design\ntemplate, the presentation exists only in your computer\u2019s memory until you save it.\nSEE ALSO For information about saving presentations, see \u201cSave and close presentations\u201d later in this chapter.\n\nTo create a new blank presentation\n1. Start PowerPoint.\n2. When the Start screen appears, press the Esc key.\nOr\n1. If PowerPoint is already running, click the File tab to display the Backstage view.\n2.

If your presentation must be compatible\nwith assistive technologies, you need to know the final file format(s) of your presentation\nbefore you create it and start adding content. Some types of content are visible in a PowerPoint\nfile in Normal view but not in other accessible file formats such as tagged PDFs. Before basing a\npresentation on a template you have not used before, test it for accessibility.\n\nYou can save the presentation in a folder on your computer or, if you have an Internet connection, in a folder on your Microsoft OneDrive. If your company is running\nMicrosoft SharePoint, you can add your SharePoint OneDrive or a different SharePoint location so that it is available from the Places pane of the Save As page, just\nlike any other folder.\nSEE ALSO For information about OneDrive, see the sidebar \u201cSave files to OneDrive\u201d\nlater in this chapter.\n\nClicking Browse at the bottom of the left pane displays the Save As dialog box, in\nwhich you assign a name to the file.\n\n52\n\n\fSave and close presentations\n\n2\n\nUse standard Windows techniques in either the Address bar or the Navigation pane to navigate to the folder\nyou want\n\nTIP If you want to create a new folder in which to store the file, click the New Folder\nbutton on the dialog box\u2019s toolbar.\n\nAfter you save a presentation for the first time, you can save changes simply by clicking the Save button on the Quick Access Toolbar.

In the File name box, enter a name for your presentation, and then click Save to\nstore the file in your file folder.\nOr\n1. Press Ctrl+S to save an existing presentation without changing the file name or\nlocation.\nTIP Programs that run on Windows use file name extensions to identify different\ntypes of files. For example, the extension .pptx identifies PowerPoint 2016, 2013,\n2010, and 2007 presentations. Windows programs do not display these extensions\nby default, and you shouldn\u2019t enter them in the File Name box. When you save a file,\nPowerPoint automatically adds whatever extension is associated with the type of file\nselected in the Save As Type box.\n\n54\n\n\fSave and close presentations\n\nTo close a presentation\n1.

The\npresentation name appears in the title bar with [Compatibility Mode] to its\nright. You can work in this mode, or you can convert the presentation to the\ncurrent format by clicking the Convert button on the Info page of the Backstage view, or by saving the presentation as a different file in the PowerPoint\nPresentation format.\nIf you work with people who are using a version of PowerPoint earlier than\n2007, you can save your presentations in a format that they will be able to use\nby changing the Save As Type setting in the Save As dialog box to PowerPoint\n97-2003 Presentation.\n\n55\n\n\fChapter 2: Create and manage presentations\n\nSave files to OneDrive\nWhether you\u2019re working in a corporate environment or at home, you have\nthe option of saving files to OneDrive. The OneDrive location you save to\nmight be part of your company\u2019s SharePoint environment, or it might be a\ncloud-based storage location that is associated with your Microsoft account.\nSaving a file in either type of OneDrive location provides the option of sharing the file with other people.\nTo save a presentation to OneDrive, display the Save As page of the Backstage view, click your OneDrive, and then specify the OneDrive folder in\nwhich you want to save the file.

It\u2019s up to you to add more slides for the content\nthat you want the presentation to include. You can create\nslides based on slide templates that are designed to hold\nspecific types of content, or you can copy existing slides\nfrom other presentations.\nWhen the presentation you\u2019re developing has multiple\nslides, you can organize them into sections. Sections\nare not visible to the audience, but they make it easier\nto work with slide content in logical segments. A logical\npresentation and an overall consistent look, punctuated\nby variations that add weight exactly where it is needed,\ncan enhance the likelihood that your intended audience\nwill receive the message you want to convey.\nThis chapter guides you through procedures related\nto adding and removing slides, dividing presentations\ninto sections, rearranging slides and sections, applying\nthemes, and changing slide backgrounds.\n\nIn this chapter\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nAdd and remove slides\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nDivide presentations into\nsections\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nRearrange slides and sections\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nApply themes\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nChange slide backgrounds\n\nPractice files\nFor this chapter, use the practice files\nfrom the PowerPoint2016SBS\\Ch03\nfolder. For practice file download\ninstructions, see the introduction.\n\nTIP The content in this chapter is about slides in\ngeneral, rather than the content of the slides. Chapters\n4 through 8 of this book are about working with the various\ntypes of slide content.\n\n61\n\n\fChapter 3: Create and manage slides\n\nAdd and remove slides\nThe appearance and structure of slides is defined by the slide layouts associated\nwith the slide master that is part of the design template. Slide layouts define the elements on specific types of slides, such as:\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nSlide backgrounds and incorporated graphics.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nText box locations, sizes, and formats.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nDefault paragraph and character formats for each text box location.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nStandard headers or footers.\n\nTIP Text boxes can contain static content that can\u2019t be changed by the presentation\nauthor (for example, a company logo), or they can serve as placeholders that define the\ndefault formatting of content entered within the text box.\n\nA slide master could have only one slide layout, but most have unique slide layouts\nfor slides that display the presentation title, section titles, and various combinations of\nslide titles and content, and a blank slide with only the background. Each slide layout\nis named; the name suggests the primary application of the slide layout, but you\naren\u2019t limited to that suggestion; you can enter any type of content in any slide layout\nand modify the layout of any slide. The slide layouts that are available in a presentation are displayed on the New Slide menu.\nSEE ALSO For information about working with slide masters and slide layouts, see\n\u201cCustomize slide masters and layouts\u201d in Chapter 12, \u201cCreate custom presentation\nelements.\u201d\n\n62\n\n\fAdd and remove slides\n\n3\n\nThe structure and design of each slide layout is visible on its thumbnail\n\nYou can modify the built-in slide layouts, create your own slide layouts, or create\nentirely new sets of slide layouts called slide masters, and you can reset slides to\nmatch their slide layouts, or apply different slide layouts to existing slides.\n\n63\n\n\fChapter 3: Create and manage slides\n\nInsert new slides\nWhen you create a new slide, PowerPoint inserts it after the currently active slide. In a\nnew presentation based on a standard PowerPoint template, a slide you add after the\ntitle slide has the Title And Content layout, and a slide added after a slide other than\nthe title slide has the layout of the preceding slide.\n\nThe Title And Content layout accommodates a title and either text or graphic content\u2014a table, chart,\n\u00addiagram, picture, clip art image, or media clip\n\nIf you want to add a slide that has a different layout, you can select the layout when\nyou insert the slide or you can change the slide layout after you create the slide.\nTo add a slide based on the default slide layout\n1. Select the slide after which you want to add the new slide.\n2. Do either of the following:\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\nOn the Home tab, in the Slides group, click the New Slide button\n(not its arrow).\nPress Ctrl+M.\nTIP You can reset slide content to the slide layout defaults by clicking the Reset\nbutton in the Slides group on the Home tab. If you add content to a slide and\nthen realize that the content would work better with a different layout, you can change\nthe slide layout by clicking the Layout arrow in the Slides group, and then clicking the\nslide layout you want to apply.\n\n64\n\n\fAdd and remove slides\n\nTo add a slide based on any slide layout\n1. Select the slide after which you want to add the new slide.\n2. On the Home tab, in the Slides group, click the New Slide arrow to display the\nNew Slide gallery and menu.\n3. In the gallery, click a slide layout thumbnail to add a slide based on that slide layout.\n\n3\n\nCopy and import slides and content\nYou can reuse slides from one presentation in another, in one of two ways: you can\ncopy the slides from the original presentation to the new presentation, or you can\nuse the Reuse Slides tool, which displays the content of an original presentation and\nallows you to choose the slides you want to insert in the new presentation.\nWithin a presentation, you can duplicate an existing slide to reuse it as the basis for a\nnew slide. You can then customize the duplicated slide instead of having to create it\nfrom scratch.\nIf you frequently include a certain type of slide in your presentations, such as a slide\nthat introduces you to the audience, you don\u2019t have to re-create the slide for each\npresentation. You can easily reuse a slide from one presentation in a different pres\u00ad\nentation. (You can use the same techniques to reuse a slide from someone else\u2019s\npresentation to standardize the appearance or structure of slide content with other\nmembers of your organization.) The slide takes on the formatting of its new presentation unless you specify otherwise.\n\nPowerPoint automatically applies the new theme to reused slides\n\n65\n\n\fChapter 3: Create and manage slides\n\nIf the content of your presentation exists in a document, you can configure that\ncontent in outline format and then import the outline into PowerPoint. For the import\nprocess to work smoothly, format the document content that you want to port into\nthe presentation as headings. PowerPoint converts some styles into slide headings,\nconverts some styles into bullet points, and ignores other styles.\n\nA slide created from an imported outline\n\nThe following table illustrates how PowerPoint converts Word document styles to\nPowerPoint slide elements.\n\n66\n\nWord document style\n\nPowerPoint presentation style\n\nTitle, Subtitle, Heading 1, any bulleted\nlist level, or any numbered list level\n\nSlide title\n\nHeading 2\n\nFirst-level bulleted list item\n\nHeading 3\n\nSecond-level bulleted list item\n\nHeading 4\n\nThird-level bulleted list item\n\nHeading 5\n\nFourth-level bulleted list item\n\nHeading 6\n\nFifth-level bulleted list item\n\nHeading 7\n\nSixth-level bulleted list item\n\nHeading 8\n\nSeventh-level bulleted list item\n\nHeading 9\n\nEighth-level bulleted list item\n\n\fAdd and remove slides\n\nTo select a single slide\n1. Do any of the following:\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\nIn Normal view, click the slide in the Thumbnails pane.\n\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\nIn Outline view, click the slide header in the Outline pane.\n\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\nIn Slide Sorter view, click the slide in the Slide pane.\n\n3\n\nTo select multiple slides\n1. In Normal view, Outline view, or Slide Sorter view, click the first slide you want\nto select.\n2. Do either of the following:\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\nTo select a contiguous series of slides, press and hold the Shift key, and then\nclick the last slide you want to select.\nTo select noncontiguous slides, press and hold the Ctrl key, and then click\neach additional slide you want to select.\n\nTo insert a copy of a slide immediately following the original slide\n1. Display the presentation in Normal view.\n2. In the Thumbnails pane, right-click the slide that you want to copy, and then\nclick Duplicate Slide.\nTo insert a copy of one or more slides anywhere in a presentation\n1. Display the presentation in Normal view or Slide Sorter view.\n2. Do either of the following to copy a slide or slides:\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\nSelect the slide thumbnail or thumbnails, and then press Ctrl+C or, on the\nHome tab, in the Clipboard group, click the Copy button.\nRight-click a slide thumbnail, and then click Copy.\n\n3. Do either of the following to insert the slide copy or copies:\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\nClick the thumbnail that you want to insert the slide copy or copies after,\nor click the empty space after the thumbnail. Then press Ctrl+V or, on the\nHome tab, in the Clipboard group, click the Paste button.\n\n67\n\n\fChapter 3: Create and manage slides\n\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\nRight-click where you want to insert the slide copy or copies, and then, in\nthe Paste Options section of the shortcut menu, click the Use Destination\nTheme button or the Keep Source F\n\u00ad ormatting button.\n\nYou can match the destination theme, retain the source theme, or paste as a picture\n\nTIP When PowerPoint displays the paste options, press H to use the\ndestination style or K to use the source style.\n\n4. Repeat step 3 to paste additional copies of the slide or slides into the\npresentation.\nTo insert a slide from another presentation\n1. Open the source and destination presentations in PowerPoint. Display each\npresentation in Normal view or Slide Sorter view.\n2. Display the two PowerPoint windows side by side.\n3. In the source presentation, select the slide or slides you want to copy.\n4. Drag the selection to the destination presentation. A horizontal line between\nslide thumbnails in Normal view or a vertical line between thumbnails in Slide\nSorter view indicates the location at which PowerPoint will insert the slides.\nPowerPoint creates copies of the slides and applies the destination theme to the\ncopies.\nOr\n68\n\n\fAdd and remove slides\n\n1. Display the destination presentation in Normal view.\n2. On the Home tab or Insert tab, in the Slides group, click the New Slide arrow.\n3.

In the Select a\nSlide Library window, browse to the slide library that contains the slide or slides\nyou want to insert.\nSEE ALSO For information about slide libraries, see the sidebar \u201cSharePoint slide\nlibraries\u201d in this topic.\n\nThe Reuse Slides pane displays thumbnails of the available slides.\n5. In the Reuse Slides pane, click the thumbnail of each slide you want to use to\ninsert that slide into your presentation.\nTIP The reused slide takes on the design of the presentation in which it is\ninserted. If you want the slide to retain the formatting from the source presentation instead, select the Keep Source Formatting check box at the bottom of the Reuse\nSlides pane.\n\n6. Close the Reuse Slides pane.\n\n69\n\n\fChapter 3: Create and manage slides\n\nTo prepare a source document to import as a presentation\n1. Enter the content that you want to appear on the slides (and any other content)\nin a document.\n2. Review the styles applied to the content you want to include in the\npresentation.\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\nTitle, Subtitle, Heading 1, and any list items will convert to\nslide titles.\nHeading 2 through Heading 8 will convert to bulleted list\nitems.\n\n3. Save and close the document.\nTo create a presentation by importing a Word document\n1. On the Open page of the Backstage view, click Browse.\n2. In the file type list, click All Files (*.*).\n3.

Select the slide after which you want to insert the new slides.\n2. On the Home tab or Insert tab, in the Slides group, click the New Slide arrow.\n3. On the New Slide menu, below the gallery, click Slides from Outline to open\nthe Insert Outline dialog box, which resembles the Open dialog box.\n4. Use standard Windows techniques to browse to the folder that contains the\nWord document you want to use for the slide titles and content.\n5. Double-click the document to insert slides based on its content.\n70\n\n\fAdd and remove slides\n\nSharePoint slide libraries\nIf your organization uses a version of Microsoft SharePoint that supports\nslide libraries, you and your colleagues can store individual slides or entire\npresentations in a slide library so they are available for use by anyone who\nhas access to the library. At the time of this writing, the current versions\nof SharePoint (SharePoint Server 2013 and SharePoint Online 2013) don\u2019t\nsupport the creation of new slide libraries but you can publish slides to and\ninsert slides from legacy libraries.)\n\n3\n\nTo store slides in a slide library, follow these steps:\n1. On the Share page of the Backstage view, click Publish Slides, and then\nclick the Publish Slides button.\n2. In the Publish Slides dialog box, select the check box of each slide\nyou want to publish. (Click the Select All button to select the entire\npresentation.)\n3. In the Publish To box, enter or paste the URL of the slide library (or click\nthe Browse button and browse to the slide library).\n\nEach slide is published individually\n\n4. Click Publish.\n\n71\n\n\fChapter 3: Create and manage slides\n\nHide and delete slides\nIf you create a slide and then later realize that you don\u2019t need it, you can delete it. If\nyou don\u2019t need the slide for a presentation to a specific audience but might need it\nlater, you can hide the slide instead. Hidden slides aren\u2019t presented in slide shows.\nThey remain available from the Thumbnails pane, but their thumbnails are dimmed\nand slide numbers crossed through with a backslash.\n\nYou can edit the content of hidden slides\n\nWhen you select a hidden slide, the Hide Slide button on the Slide Show tab is shaded\nto indicate that the command is in effect. You can edit a hidden slide in the Slide pane\njust as you can any other, so you might use this feature to keep a slide that you\u2019re still\nworking on hidden until it\u2019s final. You can unhide a slide to include it in the slide show.\nTo hide or unhide slides\n1. Select the slide or slides you want to hide or unhide.\n2. Do either of the following:\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\nRight-click the selection, and then click Hide Slide.\n\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\nOn the Slide Show tab, in the Set Up group, click the Hide Slide button.\nTIP The name of the Hide Slide command and button doesn\u2019t change; when a hidden\nslide is active, the command and button are shaded.\n\n72\n\n\fDivide presentations into sections\n\nTo delete slides\n1. Right-click a single slide, and then click Delete Slide.\nOr\n1. Select the slide or slides you want to delete.\n2. Do any of the following:\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\nRight-click the selection, and then click Delete Slide.\n\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\nOn the Home tab, in the Clipboard group, click Cut.\n\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\nPress the Delete key.\n\n3\n\nTIP When you add or delete slides in a presentation, PowerPoint renumbers all the\nsubsequent slides.\n\nDivide presentations into sections\nTo make it easier to organize and format a longer presentation, you can divide it into\nsections. In both Normal view and Slide Sorter view, sections are designated by titles\nabove their slides. They do not appear in other views, and they do not create slides or\notherwise interrupt the flow of the presentation.\n\nYou can rename, remove, move, collapse, and expand sections\n\n73\n\n\fChapter 3: Create and manage slides\n\nBecause you can collapse entire sections to leave only the section titles visible, the\nsections make it easier to focus on one part of a presentation at a time.\n\nYou can collapse sections to provide an \u201coutline\u201d of long presentations, with the number of slides in each\n\u00adsection displayed in parentheses\n\nTIP If you\u2019re collaborating with other people on the development of a presentation,\nsections are a convenient way of assigning slides to different people.\n\nSome templates include a slide layout, similar to the title slide layout, that is specifically designed for section divider slides. If you divide a long presentation into sections\nbased on topic, you might want to transfer your section titles to these slides to provide\nguidance to the audience or to mark logical points in the presentation to take breaks or\nanswer questions.\nTo create a section\n1. In Normal view or Slide Sorter view, select the slide that you want to be first in\nthe new section.\n2. On the Home tab, in the Slides group, click the Section button, and then click\nAdd Section to insert a section title named Untitled Section before the selected\nslide.\nTo rename a section\n1. In Normal view or Slide Sorter view, do either of the following to open the\nRename Section dialog box:\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\n74\n\nRight-click the section title you want to change, and then click Rename\nSection.\n\n\fRearrange slides and sections\n\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\nOn the Home tab, in the Slides group, click the Section button, and then\nclick Rename Section.\n\n3\nThe current section name is selected so that you can easily replace it\n\n2. In the Section name box, replace or edit the existing section name, and then\nclick the Rename button.\nTo collapse or expand one slide section\n1. In Normal view or Slide Sorter view, click the arrow that precedes the section\ntitle.\nTIP A right-pointing arrow indicates a collapsed section, an arrow that points to\nthe lower-right corner indicates an expanded section.\n\nTo collapse or expand all slide sections\n1. Do either of the following:\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\nOn the Home tab, in the Slides group, click the Section button, and then\nclick Collapse All or Expand All.\nRight-click any section name, and then click Expand All or Collapse All.\n\nRearrange slides and sections\nAfter you have added several slides to a presentation, you might want to rearrange\ntheir order so that they more effectively communicate your message.\nYou can rearrange a presentation by moving individual slides or entire sections of\nslides.\n\n75\n\n\fChapter 3: Create and manage slides\n\nTo move a slide within a presentation\n1. In Normal view or Slide Sorter view, drag the slide thumbnail to its new position. Notice as you drag that the other thumbnails move to indicate where the\nselected slide will appear when you release the mouse button.\nOr\n1. Select the slide thumbnail, and then press Ctrl+X or on the Home tab, in the\nClipboard group, click Cut.\n2. Do either of the following:\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\nClick the slide thumbnail that you want to insert the cut slide after, and then\npress Ctrl+V or, in the Clipboard group, click Paste.\nClick between the other slide thumbnails to insert a thin red marker (horizontal in Normal view or vertical in Slide Sorter view) where you want to\nmove the slide. Then press Ctrl+V or, in the Clipboard group, click Paste.\n\nOr\n1. Right-click the slide thumbnail, and then click Cut.\n2. Right-click between the other slide thumbnails where you want to move the\nslide.\nTIP The thin red destination marker appears only when you click between\nthumbnails, not when you right-click between thumbnails.\n\n3. In the Paste Options section of the shortcut menu, click the Use Destination\nTheme button or the Keep Source Formatting button.\nTIP When PowerPoint displays the paste options, press H to use the destination\nstyle or K to use the source style.\n\nTo move a section within a presentation\n1. Click the title of the section of slides you want to move, to select all the slides in\nthe section.\n2. Drag the section to its new location.\nOr\n76\n\n\fRearrange slides and sections\n\n1. Right-click the section title, and then click Move Section Up or Move Section\nDown to move the section and all its slides before the preceding section or\nafter the following section.\nTIP The Move Section commands aren\u2019t available on the Section menu; they are\navailable only on the shortcut menu that appears when you right-click a section title.\n\n3\n\nTo merge a section into the preceding section by removing the section divider\n1. Click the title of the section of slides you want to ungroup.\n2. On the Home tab, in the Slides group, click the Section button, and then click\nRemove Section.\nOr\n1. Right-click the section title, and then click Remove Section.\nTo merge all sections by removing all section dividers\n1. On the Home tab, in the Slides group, click the Section button, and then click\nRemove All Sections.\nTo delete a section of slides\n1. Click the title of the section of slides you want to delete, to select all the slides in\nthe section.\n2. Press the Delete key.\nOr\n1. Right-click the section title, and then click Remove Section & Slides.\n\nIf the selected section is collapsed, PowerPoint prompts you to confirm the deletion\n\n2. If PowerPoint prompts you to confirm the deletion, click Yes to delete the\n\u00adsection title and all the slides in the section.\nTIP The Remove Section & Slides command isn\u2019t available on the Section menu; it is\navailable only on the shortcut menu that appears when you right-click a section title.\n\n77\n\n\fChapter 3: Create and manage slides\n\nApply themes\nThe appearance of every presentation that you create is governed by a theme\u2014a combination of colors, fonts, effect styles, and background graphics or formatting that\ncoordinates the appearance of all the presentation elements. Even a blank presentation\nhas a theme: the Office theme, which has a white slide background, a standard set of\ntext and accent colors, and the Office font set, which uses Calibri Light for headings and\nCalibri for body text.\nPowerPoint and the other Office 2016 apps share a common set of themes and theme\nelements. This enables you to easily produce coordinated print and presentation\nmaterials. Approximately 30 of these themes are available to you from the PowerPoint\nThemes gallery. Many of the themes come with predefined variants, which have a different color scheme or background graphic.\n\nThe built-in Office themes for PowerPoint\n\nEach thumbnail in the PowerPoint Themes gallery displays a sample of the font set\nin the form of an uppercase and lowercase letter A (Aa) and the color scheme in the\nform of colored blocks over the default title slide. Title slides frequently have background graphics that set the tone for the presentation. The standard slides associated\nwith the theme will often have a more-subtle background graphic that coordinates\nwith the title slide background. You can choose to hide the background graphic and\nuse only a colored background if you want to.\nYou can change the theme that is applied to an entire presentation or to only one section of the presentation. If you like the colors of one theme, the fonts of another, and\nthe effects of another, you can mix and match theme elements. You can also create\nyour own themes.\n78\n\n\fApply themes\n\nSEE ALSO For information about creating themes and custom theme elements, see\n\u201cCreate custom themes\u201d in Chapter 12, \u201cCreate custom presentation elements.\u201d\n\nWhen you\u2019re working in Normal view you can use the Live Preview feature to see how\nyour presentation would look with a different theme applied. Simply point to any\ntheme and pause. PowerPoint temporarily applies the selected formatting to the slide\nin the Slide pane. This makes it easy to try different themes and theme elements until\nyou find the ones you want.\n\n3\n\nTo apply a standard theme to a presentation\n1. Display the presentation in Normal view.\n2. On the Design tab, in the Themes group, click the More button (below the\nscroll arrows) to display the menu that includes the Office theme gallery and\nany custom templates on your computer.\n3. Point to thumbnails in the gallery to display the theme names in tooltips and\npreview the effect of applying the themes to your presentation.\n\nChoose a theme that enhances the content of your presentation\n\n4.\n\nClick a theme thumbnail to apply that theme to the entire presentation.\n\n79\n\n\fChapter 3: Create and manage slides\n\nTo change the color scheme of the presentation\n1.

On the Variants menu, click Effects, and then click the effect style you want to\napply.\n\nThe effect style preview color coordinates with the current color scheme\n\n81\n\n\fChapter 3: Create and manage slides\n\nTo apply a theme or theme variant to only part of a presentation\n1. Create a section that contains the slides you want to have a different theme.\n2. Click the section header to select the section.\n3. Apply the theme or theme element.\n\nChange slide backgrounds\nThe presentation theme includes a standard background. The background might be a\ncolor or it might include a background graphic.\n\nA variety of thematic background graphics\n\n82\n\n\fChange slide backgrounds\n\nYou can customize slide backgrounds by removing the background graphic and filling the slide background with a solid color, a color gradient, a texture, a pattern, or a\npicture of your choice. You make these changes in the Format Background pane.\n\n3\n\nYou can control the color, texture, pattern, or picture in the background of one or all slides\n\nEach of the options in the Format Background pane has specific settings that appear\nwhen you select the option.\nA solid color background is a good choice for readability, but if you want to add some\ninterest without a lot of distraction, you can use a color gradient in which a solid color\ngradually changes to another. PowerPoint offers several light-to-dark and dark-to-light\ngradient patterns based on the color scheme.\n\n83\n\n\fChapter 3: Create and manage slides\n\nYou can also create custom gradients of two, three, or more colors. Each change in\ncolor within a gradient is controlled by a gradient stop. For each gradient stop, you can\nspecify the location and specific color (including the transparency and brightness of the\ncolor). A color gradient can have from 2 to 10 gradient stops.\n\nA gradient can include up to 10 color changes\n\n84\n\n\fChange slide backgrounds\n\nIf you want something fancier than a solid color or a color gradient, you can give the\nslide background a texture or pattern. PowerPoint comes with several built-in textures\nthat you can easily apply to the background of slides.\n\n3\n\nChoose a background that doesn\u2019t overpower your presentation\n\nIf none of these meets your needs, you might want to use a picture of a textured surface. For a dramatic effect, you can even incorporate a picture of your own, although\nthese are best reserved for small areas of the slide rather than the entire background.\n\n85\n\n\fChapter 3: Create and manage slides\n\nIf you prefer to use a simple pattern rather than a texture, you can choose from 48\npatterns and set the background and foreground color to your liking.\n\nClick any pattern to preview it on the slide\n\nTo display the Format Background pane\n1.

Regardless of the method\nof delivery, a presentation has no value if it doesn\u2019t keep\nthe attention of the audience. An element that can make\nthe difference between an adequate presentation and\na great presentation is the judicious use of animated\ncontent, sound, and videos. By incorporating these\ndynamic effects, you can grab and keep the attention of\nyour audience. You can emphasize key points, control\nthe focus of the discussion, and entertain in ways that will\nmake your message memorable.\nWith PowerPoint 2016, you have so many opportunities\nto add pizzazz to your slides that it is easy to end up with\na presentation that looks more like an amateur experiment than a professional slide show. When you first start\nadding animations, sound, and videos to your slides, it\nis best to err on the conservative side. As you gain more\nexperience, you\u2019ll learn how to mix and match effects to\nget the results you want for a particular audience.\n\nIn this chapter\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nAnimate text and pictures on\nslides\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nCustomize animation effects\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nAdd audio content to slides\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nAdd video content to slides\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nCompress media to decrease\nfile size\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nAdd and manage slide\ntransitions\n\nPractice files\nFor this chapter, use the practice files\nfrom the PowerPoint2016SBS\\Ch08\nfolder. For practice file download\ninstructions, see the introduction.\n\nThis chapter guides you through procedures related to\nanimating text and pictures on slides, customizing animation effects, adding audio and video content to slides,\ncompressing media to decrease file size, and adding and\nmanaging slide transitions.\n\n245\n\n\fChapter 8: Add sound and movement to slides\n\nAnimate text and pictures on slides\nIn the context of PowerPoint, animation refers to the movement of an element on a\nslide. When used appropriately, animated slide elements can both capture the audience\u2019s attention and effectively convey information. You can animate any individual\nobjects on a slide, including text containers, pictures, and shapes. (You can\u2019t animate\nobjects that are part of the slide background or slide master, other than as part of the\ntransition between slides.)\nSEE ALSO For information about the movement that occurs between slides, see \u201cAdd\nand manage slide transitions\u201d later in this chapter.\n\nThoughtfully designed animations can be very informative, particularly for audience\nmembers who are more receptive to visual input than to auditory input. Animations\nhave the added benefit of providing a consistent message with or without a presenter\nto discuss or externally illustrate a process.\n\nThe elements of a multipart animation\n\nYou can configure four types of animations: the appearance, movement, emphasis,\nand disappearance of objects on the slide. There are multiple options within these\nfour categories. The options are categorized as Basic, Subtle, Moderate, and Exciting\n(although you might have a different concept of \u201cexciting\u201d than the PowerPoint developer who categorized the effects). A few more animation effects are available for text\nthan for other slide objects.\n246\n\n\fAnimate text and pictures on slides\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the animation effects that are available in PowerPoint 2016:\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nEntrance animations An object with an animated entrance is not visible when\nthe slide first appears. (It is visible during the development process, but not\nwhen you present the slide show.) It then appears on the slide in the manner\nspecified by the entrance effect. Some entrance effects are available in the\n\u00adAnimation gallery. They\u2019re illustrated in green, and their icons provide some\nidea of the movement associated with the effect.\n\nHave fun experimenting with the different effects\n\nClicking More Entrance Effects at the bottom of the Animation menu opens a\ndialog box that displays all the available entrance animations by category to\nhelp you choose an appropriate effect.\n\n8\n\nThe entrance animation effects available for text\n\n247\n\n\fChapter 8: Add sound and movement to slides\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nEmphasis animations These effects animate an object that is already visible\non the slide to draw attention to it, without changing its location. The emphasis\neffects that are available in the Animation gallery are illustrated in yellow.\n\nEffects range from subtle to bold\n\nClicking More Emphasis Effects at the bottom of the Animation menu opens a\ndialog box that displays all the available emphasis animations by category.\n\nThe emphasis animations available for text and images\n\n248\n\n\fAnimate text and pictures on slides\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nMotion Path animations These effects move an object along a path that you\nspecify, over a period of time that you specify. A few simple motion paths are\navailable from the Animation gallery, but a surprisingly large variety is available from the dialog box that opens when you click More Motion Paths at the\nbottom of the Animation menu.\n\n8\n\nThe motion path animations available for text\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nExit animations These effects take an existing object through a process that\nresults in the object no longer being visible on the slide. The exit effects that are\navailable in the Animation gallery are illustrated in red.\n\nChoose an effect that suits the style of your presentation\n\nAdditional exit effects are available from the Change Exit Effect dialog box.\n\n249\n\n\fChapter 8: Add sound and movement to slides\n\nThe exit animations available for text\n\nAnimations can be very simple, or very complex. Many animations have options that you\ncan configure, such as the direction, speed, size, or color. For example, when you configure an entrance effect for a bulleted list, you can specify whether to have the entire list\nenter the slide at the same time, or to have only one bulleted item enter at a time. After\nyou choose an effect, the applicable options are available on the Effect Options menu.\n\nSome animations have options, and others don\u2019t\n\n250\n\n\fAnimate text and pictures on slides\n\nYou can apply multiple animation effects (for example, an entrance effect and an\nemphasis effect) to a single object. As you assign animations to slide objects, numbers\nappear on the objects to specify the order of the animation effects. The numbers are\nvisible only when the Animation tab is active.\n\n8\nEach number represents one animation\n\nAs you build an animated slide, you can add and animate individual elements, or you\ncan add all the elements to the slide first, and then animate them. Regardless of the\nprocess you choose, position the objects on the slide as follows:\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nEntrance effects Position the object where you want it to end up after it enters\nthe slide.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nEmphasis effects Position the object where it will be before and after the\neffect.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nExit effects Position the object where it will be before it leaves the slide.\n\nAfter all the elements are in place, animate them in the order you want the animations to occur. (If you\u2019re animating multiple objects, it might be helpful to write out\na description of the process before starting.) If you animate something out of order,\ndon\u2019t worry\u2014you can reorder the animations from within the Animation Pane.\n\n251\n\n\fChapter 8: Add sound and movement to slides\n\nAnimate this\nAnimations can greatly enrich presentation content. However, incorporating\na \u201cdazzling\u201d array of animation effects into a presentation can be distracting\nor confusing to the audience. Ensure that the time you put into creating an\nanimation has value to you and to your audience members.\nConsider using animations to provide subliminal information\u2014for example,\nin a multipart presentation, use one consistent entrance effect for the part\nopener titles to draw the attention of the audience members and cue them to\na change of subject.\nAn excellent use of animation is to create \u201cbuild slides\u201d that add information\nin layers and essentially culminate in a review slide. Simple examples of build\nslides include:\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nA bulleted list that adds one item to the list at a time. For greater\nimpact, display an image related to the current list item, and replace\nthe image as each new list item appears.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nA pie chart that displays each chart wedge individually, and finishes\nwith the complete pie. Make this even more informative by displaying a\ndetailed breakdown of the chart data for each category as you display\nits chart wedge.\n\nYou could achieve these effects by creating series of separate slides, but it\u2019s\nmuch simpler to animate the list or chart object.\nA more difficult but often worthwhile use of slide object animation is to\nprovide a visual image of a process as you describe it. You can narrate the\nanimation in person or, if you\u2019re going to distribute the presentation electronically, you can record the narration and synchronize the animations with\nthe relevant wording.\n\nTo animate an object on a slide\n1. Display the slide in the Slide pane, and select the object that you want to animate, or its container. (For example, if you want to animate the entrance of a\nbulleted list, select the text box that contains the bulleted list.)\n252\n\n\fAnimate text and pictures on slides\n\n2. On the Animations tab, in the Animation group, click the More button to\ndisplay the Animation menu and gallery.\nTIP If the menu expands to cover the slide content, you can drag the handle in\nthe lower-right corner of the menu to resize it.\n\n8\n\nThe Animation gallery and menu\n\n253\n\n\fChapter 8: Add sound and movement to slides\n\n3. Do either of the following:\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\nIn the Animation gallery, click the icon that represents the animation you\nwant to apply.\nOn the Animation menu, click the More command for the type of animation you want to apply, and then in the Change Type Effect dialog box, click\nthe animation you want.\n\nPowerPoint displays a live preview of the selected animation effect and adds\nan animation number adjacent to the object. A star appears next to the slide\nthumbnail to indicate that the slide contains either an animation or a transition.\n\nIn the Thumbnails pane, the star below the slide number indicates the presence of movement on\nthe slide\n\nTIP When you apply an animation, PowerPoint automatically previews (plays) the\nanimation. If this is distracting to you, you can turn off this feature by clicking the\nPreview arrow (in the Preview group on the Animations tab) and then clicking AutoPreview to\nremove the check mark that indicates the option is turned on.\n\n254\n\n\fAnimate text and pictures on slides\n\nTo select an applied animation\n1. On the slide or in the Animation Pane, click the animation number.\nTo display or hide the Animation Pane\n1. On the Animations tab, in the Advanced Animation group, click the Animation\nPane button.\nTIP You can expand and collapse sets of animation effects in the Animation\nPane to help you focus on those you want to work with.\n\nTo configure animation options\n1. Apply the animation, or select a previously applied animation.\n2. On the Animations tab, in the Animation group, click the Effect Options\nbutton. (If the button is unavailable, the animation has no configurable\noptions.)\nThe Effect Options menu has one titled section for each option that you can\nconfigure.\n\n8\n\n3. On the Effect Options menu, click one option in each section.\nTo apply multiple animation effects to one object\n1. Apply the first animation effect and configure any options.\n2. Select the object (not the animation). The existing animation information is\nhighlighted on the Animations tab and in the Animation Pane.\n3. On the Animations tab, in the Advanced Animation group, click the Add\nAnimation button. In the Add Animation gallery, click the additional animation\nyou want to apply.\nTo copy a set of animation effects from one object to another object\n1. Select the source object.\n2. On the Animations tab, in the Advanced Animation group, click the Animation\nPainter button.\n3. Point to the object you want to format. When a paintbrush appears to the right\nof the cursor, click the object to apply the formatting.\n255\n\n\fChapter 8: Add sound and movement to slides\n\nTIP The Animation Painter is similar to the Format Painter. If you click the Animation\nPainter button one time, you can copy the formatting to one other object. If you\ndouble-click the Animation Painter button, you can copy the formatting to many other objects,\nuntil you click the button again or press Esc to deactivate it.\n\nTo preview animations\n1. Do any of the following:\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\nTo preview all animations on a slide in order, on the Animations tab, in the\nPreview group, click the Preview button.\nTo preview a specific animation and those that follow, in the Animation\nPane, click the first animation, and then click the Play From button.\nTo preview one animation, select the animation on the slide and then, in the\nAnimation Pane, click the Play Selected button.\n\nTo remove animation effects from slide objects\n1. Do either of the following in the Animation Pane:\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\nTo remove one animation, right-click the animation, and then click Remove.\nTo remove all animations, click any animation, press Ctrl+A to select all the\nanimations, and then press Delete.\n\nCustomize animation effects\nMany presentations don\u2019t require much in the way of animation, and you might find\nthat transitions and ready-made animation effects will meet all your animation needs.\nHowever, for those occasions when you want a presentation with pizzazz, you can\ncustomize the animation effects.\nTIP Animations can be useful for self-running presentations, where there is no\npresenter to lead the audience from one concept to another.\n\nAfter you apply an animation effect, you can fine-tune its action in the following ways:\n\n256\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nSpecify the direction, shape, or sequence of the animation. (The options vary\ndepending on the type of animation you apply.)\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nSpecify what action will trigger the animation. For example, you can specify\nthat clicking a different object on the slide will animate the selected object.\n\n\fCustomize animation effects\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nAs an alternative to clicking the mouse button to build animated slides, have\nPowerPoint build the slide for you.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nControl the implementation speed (duration) of each animation, or delay an\nanimation effect.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nChange the order of the animation effects.\n\nEntrance and exit effects cause objects to appear and disappear when you\u2019re previewing or presenting a slide. However, all the objects are visible while you\u2019re working in\nthe Slide pane. A very helpful tool when managing multiple animated objects on a\nslide is the Animation Pane. Each numbered animation on the slide has a corresponding entry in the Animation Pane that provides information and options for managing\nthe animations.\n\n8\n\nManage all aspects of animations from the Animation Pane\n\n257\n\n\fChapter 8: Add sound and movement to slides\n\nThe color coding of the Entrance, Emphasis, and Exit effects is visible in the Animation\nPane, and a timeline is available at the bottom of the pane. The visual indicators to\nthe right of each object name represent the type, starting point, and duration of each\nanimation event, as follows:\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nThe indicator color represents the animation type (green for Entrance, yellow\nfor Emphasis, blue for Motion Path, and red for Exit).\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nThe left side of the indicator aligns with the animation starting point. If the left\nsides of two indicators align, those animations start at the same time. If the\nleft side of an indicator aligns with the right side of the previous indicator, the\nanimations run in order.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nThe width of the indicator is the animation duration as it relates to the timeline\nat the bottom of the Animation Pane.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nThe right side of the indicator is either triangular or square. A square indicates\nthat the animation has a fixed duration; a triangular edge indicates that the\nduration is set to Auto.\n\nEach animation is an individual event. By default, each animation starts immediately\n\u201con click,\u201d meaning when you switch to the slide, click the mouse button, tap the\nscreen, or press an arrow key\u2014any action that would otherwise move to the next\nslide. You can change the animation \u201ctrigger\u201d either to run with or after another\nevent, to run it after a certain length of time, or to run it when you click a specific screen\nelement or reach a bookmark in an audio or video clip. You control these settings\neither from the Advanced Animation and Timing groups on the Animations tab, or\nfrom the Animation Pane.\nClicking an animation in the Animation Pane selects the animation and displays an\narrow to the right of the animation timing indicators. Clicking the arrow displays a menu\nof actions. Some of these actions are available from the Animations tab, but the effect\n\n258\n\n\fCustomize animation effects\n\noptions available from this menu are more complex than those on the Effect Options\nmenu in the Animation group.\n\nYou can configure these actions from the Animation Pane to customize an animation\n\nClicking Effect Options on the shortcut menu provides access to an effect-specific\ndialog box where you can refine that type of animation in the following ways:\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nSpecify whether the animation should be accompanied by a sound effect.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nDim or hide the element after the animation, or have it change to a specific\ncolor.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nIf the animation is applied to text, animate all the text at once or animate it\nword by word or letter by letter.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nRepeat an animation and specify what triggers its action.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nIf a slide has more than one level of bullet points, animate different levels\nseparately.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nIf an object has text, animate the object and the text together (the default) or\nseparately, or animate one but not the other.\n\n8\n\n259\n\n\fChapter 8: Add sound and movement to slides\n\nThe dialog box title is the animation type, and the options available in the dialog box\nare specific to that type of animation.\n\nSome of the settings available through the Animation Pane Effect Options menu\n\nTo open the effect-specific dialog box for an animation\n1. Do either of the following in the Animation Pane:\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\nPoint to the animation, click the arrow, and then click Effect Options.\n\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\nDouble-click the animation.\n\nTo change the order of animation effects on a slide\n1. On the slide or in the Animation Pane, select the animation you want to\nreorder.\n2. On the Animations tab, in the Timing group, click Move Earlier or Move Later.\nOr\n1. In the Animation Pane, select the animation or animations that you want to move.\n2. Drag the selection to the new position in the Animation Pane. The animation\nnumbers change to reflect the new positions.\nTIP After reordering animations, it\u2019s a good idea to preview the animations to ensure\nthat the actions happen in a logical order.\n\n260\n\n\fCustomize animation effects\n\nTo set the trigger for a selected animation\nTIP Many of the following settings can be configured on the Animations tab, in the\nAnimation Pane, or in the effect-specific options dialog box. We\u2019ve provided one path to\nthe setting, but use the interface that you\u2019re most comfortable with.\n\n1. Do any of the following in the Timing group on the Animations tab:\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\nTo start the animation manually, click the Start list, and then click On Click.\nTo start the animation based on the previous animation, click the Start list,\nand then click With Previous or After Previous.\nTo start the animation a specific period of time after the trigger, specify the\nDelay in seconds.\n\nOr\n1. Do either of the following in the Advanced Animation group on the Animations tab:\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\n8\n\nTo start the animation when you click an object on the slide, click the Trigger\nbutton, click On Click of, and then click a trigger object on the slide.\nTo start the animation at a specific point during the playback of an audio\nclip or video clip, in the Trigger list, click On Bookmark, and then click a\nbookmark that you\u2019ve set in an audio or video clip.\nSEE ALSO For information about setting bookmarks, see the sidebar\n\u201cBookmark points of interest in media clips\u201d later in this chapter.\n\nOr\n1. In the Animation Pane, drag the colored indicator bar to the starting point\nyou want.\nTo set the duration of a selected animation\n1. Do either of the following:\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\nOn the Animations tab, in the Timing group, specify the Duration in\nseconds.\nIn the Animation Pane, drag the right side of the colored indicator bar to\nset the duration in accordance with the timeline at the bottom of the pane.\n261\n\n\fChapter 8: Add sound and movement to slides\n\nTo add a sound effect to an animation\n1. In the Animation Pane, double-click the animation to open the animationspecific effect options dialog box.\n2. On the Effect tab, click the Sound list, and then click the sound effect you want\nto assign to the animation.\n3. Click the speaker icon to the right of the Sound list to display the volume slider,\nand set the volume level of the sound effect.\n4. Click OK to close the dialog box.\n\nBookmark points of interest in media clips\nBookmarks are a useful new feature for PowerPoint users who incorporate\naudio, video, and animation into presentations. You can insert bookmarks\ninto audio and video clips to identify locations either that you want to be able\nto quickly get to or that you want to use as triggers for other events.\nFor example, you could create an animation that visually describes a process,\nand record a narration that verbally describes the process. Instead of setting\nup a series of timing points to synchronize the narration and animation, you\ncould insert bookmarks at key points in the narrative audio clip that trigger\nspecific segments of the animation to play.\nAs another example, you could embed a video on a slide, and record audio\ncomments about certain parts of the video. Then you can insert bookmarks\nat those points of the video to trigger the playback of the relevant audio\ncomments.\nWhen you insert bookmarks in audio and video clips within PowerPoint,\nthose bookmarks exist only in PowerPoint and don\u2019t affect the original\nrecording.\n\n262\n\n\fCustomize animation effects\n\nTo insert a bookmark in an audio or video clip, follow these steps:\n1. Display the slide in Normal view and select the audio or video clip to\ndisplay the Audio Tools or Video Tools tab group.\n2. Play the clip by clicking the Play button on the playback toolbar or in\nthe Preview group on the Playback tool tab.\n3. At the point that you want to insert a bookmark, click the\nAdd Bookmark button in the Bookmarks group on the\nPlayback tool tab.\n4. To insert additional bookmarks, repeat steps 2 and 3.\nBookmarks in audio or video clips are indicated by circles on the playback\ntoolbar. Pointing to a bookmark on the toolbar displays a ScreenTip that\nincludes the bookmark name. You can select a bookmark as the starting\npoint for an animation, from the Trigger list on the Animations tab.\n\n8\n\nAdding a bookmark to a media clip makes it available as a trigger\n\nIf you create a bookmark but then don\u2019t need it, you can remove it by selecting it and then clicking the Remove Bookmark button in the Bookmarks\ngroup on the Playback tool tab.\n\n263\n\n\fChapter 8: Add sound and movement to slides\n\nAdd audio content to slides\nYou can enhance presentations by adding sound to slide transitions, to animated\ncontent, to an individual slide, or to the presentation as a whole. For example, you\ncould run a presentation that provides basic information and icebreakers during\nthe time leading up to your actual presentation. You can add a pleasant royalty-free\nsoundtrack that loops while the presentation plays, to avoid the discomfort of a room\nfull of people who don\u2019t want to break the silence.\nIf you plan to distribute a presentation electronically for people to watch on their own,\nyou might want to add audio narration to an animation, or provide narration for the\nentire presentation.\nSEE ALSO For information about adding sound effects to animations, see \u201cCustomize\nanimation effects\u201d earlier in this chapter; and to slide transitions, see \u201cAdd and manage\nslide transitions\u201d later in this chapter.\n\nYou can add prerecorded audio content to a presentation, or record your own content\ndirectly within PowerPoint. PowerPoint supports the most common audio formats\u2014\nMP3, MP4, Windows audio (.wav) and Windows Media audio (.wma), and more specialized formats such as ADTS, AU, FLAC, MIDI, and MKA audio.\nTIP The Insert Online Audio feature that was present in earlier versions of PowerPoint is\nnot available in PowerPoint 2016. However, you can download royalty-free audio music\nand sound effects from many online sources. Some of these require that you credit the website\nas the source, so be sure to read the website fine print. When you locate an audio clip that you\nwant to use, you can download it to your computer and follow the instructions in this topic to\nuse it in a PowerPoint presentation.\n\nWhen you add audio to a slide (rather than to an animation or transition), the audio\nicon (shaped like a speaker) and an accompanying trigger icon appear on the slide,\nand the trigger event appears in the Animation Pane.\n\n264\n\n\fAdd audio content to slides\n\nThe trigger is created and added to the Animation Pane automatically\n\nWhen the audio icon is selected, the Audio Tools tab group, which includes the\nFormat and Playback tool tabs, appears on the ribbon, and audio playback controls\nappear on the slide.\n\n8\nThe playback controls are simple but provide sufficient options\n\nYou can start audio content on a slide automatically or from the playback controls.\nThe playback controls are visible only when the audio icon is selected. The icon isn\u2019t\nobtrusive, but you can disguise or hide it if you want to.\n\nYou can change the size or angle of the audio icon by using the sizing handles or rotation handle\n\n265\n\n\fChapter 8: Add sound and movement to slides\n\nYou can customize the audio content by using commands on the Playback tool tab,\nas follows:\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nEdit the audio content so that only part of it plays.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nMake the sound gradually increase and decrease in volume.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nAdjust the volume or mute the sound.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nSpecify whether the audio content plays:\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\nAutomatically when the slide appears.\n\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\nOnly if you click its icon.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nMake the audio object invisible while the presentation is displayed in Reading\nview or Slide Show view.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nSpecify that the audio content should play continuously until you stop it.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nEnsure that the audio content starts from the beginning each time it is played.\n\nTo insert an audio clip onto a slide\n1. Save the audio clip on your computer or on a network-connected location.\n2. On the Insert tab, in the Media group, click the Audio button, and then click\nAudio on My PC to open the Insert Audio dialog box.\n3. In the Insert Audio dialog box, browse to and select the audio file, and then\nclick the Insert button.\nOr\n1. In File Explorer, open the folder that contains the audio file.\n2. Arrange the File Explorer and PowerPoint windows on your screen so that both\nare visible.\n3. Drag the audio file from File Explorer to the slide.\nTo record audio directly onto a slide\n1. On the Insert tab, in the Media group, click the Audio button, and then click\nRecord Audio to open the Record Sound dialog box.\n2. In the Name box, enter a name to uniquely identify the recording. Then click\nthe Record button (labeled with a red circle).\n266\n\n\fAdd audio content to slides\n\nThe Record Sound dialog box\n\n3. Speak or otherwise provide the audio that you want to record. When you\nfinish, click the Stop button (labeled with a blue square). The audio icon and\nan accompanying trigger icon appear in the center of the slide, and the trigger\nevent appears in the Animation Pane.\nTIP If you record multiple clips, the audio icons stack up in the same location on\nthe slide. It might be necessary to move one or more out of the way to get to an\nearlier clip.\n\nTo restrict the playback of an audio clip to a specific segment\n\n8\n\n1. Select the audio icon. On the Playback tool tab, in the Editing group, click the\nTrim Audio button to open the Trim Audio dialog box.\n\nYou can trim audio from the beginning and end of the clip, but not from the middle\n\n2. In the Trim Audio dialog box, do any of the following:\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\nClick the Play button to play the clip, and then click the Pause button to\npause when you locate a point that you want to mark.\nDrag the green Start marker to specify a playback starting point other than\nthe beginning of the clip. (If you drag the marker near the point at which\nyou paused the playback, the marker snaps to that location.)\n267\n\n\fChapter 8: Add sound and movement to slides\n\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\nDrag the red End marker to specify a playback end point other than the end\nof the clip.\nSelect the Start or End marker, and then click the Previous Frame or Next\nFrame button to move the selected marker back or forward 0.1 seconds\n(one-tenth of a second).\n\n3. When you finish, click OK to close the Trim Audio dialog box.\nTIP Trimming the audio affects only the playback of the audio on the slide, not the\noriginal audio clip. You can re-trim or restore the audio clip at any time. For information about discarding trimmed content, see \u201cCompress media to decrease file size\u201d later in\nthis chapter.\n\nTo fade into or out of an audio clip\n1. Select the audio icon. On the Playback tool tab, in the Editing group, do the\nfollowing:\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\nIn the Fade In box, specify the length of time over which you want to\nincrease the audio to full volume.\nIn the Fade Out box, specify the number of seconds at the end of the audio\nclip over which you want to decrease the audio volume.\nTIP The Fade In and Fade Out times can be specified precisely down to a\nhundredth of a second.\n\nTo modify or hide the audio icon\n1. Select the audio icon, and then do any of the following:\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\n268\n\nDrag the sizing handles to make the icon larger or smaller.\nDrag the icon to a different location on the slide, or to a location slightly off\nthe slide but still on the development canvas.\n\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\nUse the commands on the Format tool tab to change the icon\u2019s appearance.\n\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\nReplace the default icon with a different image (such as a picture or logo).\n\n\fAdd audio content to slides\n\nTo manually start audio playback\n1. Do any of the following:\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\nIn Normal view, Reading view, or Slide Show view, point to the audio icon.\nWhen the playback controls appear, click the Play button.\nIn Normal view, click the audio icon, and then click the Play button on the\nplayback toolbar or in the Preview group on the Playback tool tab.\nIn Slide Show view, after the audio icon has had focus, press Alt+P.\nTIP To play sounds and other audio content, you must have a sound card and speakers\ninstalled.\n\nTo automatically start audio playback\n1. On the Playback tool tab, in the Audio Options group, in the Start list, click\nAutomatically. Then select the Loop until Stopped check box.\n\n8\n\nTIP If your presentation might be viewed by people using assistive technologies such as\nscreen readers or text-to-speech tools, you should avoid starting audio clips or files\nautomatically. Instead, allow the user to play the audio content after the tool has finished\ncommunicating the slide content.\n\nTo prevent an audio clip from stopping when the slide changes\n1. On the Playback tool tab, do either of the following:\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\nTo play to the end of the audio and then stop, in the Audio Options group,\nselect the Play Across Slides check box.\nTo loop the audio until the end of the slide show regardless of other audio\ntracks, in the Audio Styles group, click the Play in Background button.\n\n269\n\n\fChapter 8: Add sound and movement to slides\n\nTo loop (repeat) an audio clip\n1. On the Playback tool tab, in the Audio Options group, select the Loop until\nStopped check box.\nTIP To automatically start and continuously play an audio clip through an entire slide\nshow, configure the settings as follows: On the Playback tool tab, in the Audio Options\ngroup, change the Start setting to Automatically. Then select the Play Across Slides, Loop Until\nStopped, and Hide During Show check boxes.\n\nAdd video content to slides\nSometimes the best way to ensure that your audience understands your message\nis to show a video. For example, if your company has developed a short advertising\nvideo, it makes more sense to include the video in a presentation about marketing\nplans than to try to describe it by using bullet points or even pictures. To save you the\ntrouble of switching between PowerPoint and a video player, you can embed a video\nrecording directly onto a slide, and then play the video as part of presenting the slide\nshow. This is a much smoother way of presenting information from multiple sources\nthan switching between them.\nYou can insert a video onto a slide from your computer or a connected local storage\ndevice, from your Facebook account, from YouTube, or from a website that provides\nan \u201cembed code\u201d (basically, an address that you can link to).\nTIP If a publicly posted video clip has an \u201cembed code\u201d available, you can link to the\nonline video rather than embedding it in the slide show. PowerPoint uses the embed\ncode to locate and play the video. As long as the video remains available in its original location\n(and you have an active Internet connection), you will be able to access and play the video from\nthe slide at any time.\n\n270\n\n\fAdd video content to slides\n\nAfter you insert the video, you can format its representation on the slide in all the\nways that you can other imagery. You can move and resize it, display it in a frame of\nyour choice, and even adjust the brightness or color contrast.\n\n8\nYou can resize the video frame\n\nTIP The changes that you make to an image on a slide also affect the video playback.\nSo, for example, if you change the aspect ratio of the video representation on the slide,\nimagery in the video might appear to be skewed.\n\nWhen working with local videos that you embed rather than online videos that you\nlink to, you can fade into and out from the video playback, and manage the content\nof the video by trimming it to play only a specific portion. You can insert bookmarks\nto use as triggers for other events (for example, you might display a list of selling\npoints as each is presented in the advertising video).\n\n271\n\n\fChapter 8: Add sound and movement to slides\n\nSet your start and end times to focus on the specific content you want to highlight\n\nWhen you're previewing or presenting a slide show, you can play (and pause) embedded audio or video, move around within the recording, and control the volume by using\nthe controls that appear when the audio icon or video placeholder image is active.\nWhen playing back a video, you can display it at the embedded size or full screen.\nMany of the processes for managing video clips are the same as those for managing\naudio clips:\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nRestricting the playback of a video clip to a specific segment\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nFading into or out of a video clip\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nManually or automatically starting video playback\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nPreventing a video clip from stopping when the slide changes\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nLooping a video clip\nSEE ALSO For additional information related to the preceding processes, see \u201cAdd\naudio content to slides\u201d earlier in this chapter.\n\n272\n\n\fAdd video content to slides\n\nTo insert a video clip onto a slide\n1. On a slide that includes a content placeholder, click the Insert Video button in\nthe content placeholder to display the Insert Video window that contains links\nto all the video sources you\u2019ve configured Office to connect to.\n\n8\n\nYou can insert video clips from a variety of sources\n\n2. In the Insert Video window, click the source of the video that you want to\ninsert, and then follow the process to insert a video from the selected source.\nOr\n1. On any slide, on the Insert tab, in the Media group, click the Insert Video\nbutton, and then do either of the following:\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\nClick Online Video to open the Insert Video window. In the Insert Video\nwindow, click the source of the video that you want to insert, and then\nfollow the process to insert a video from the selected source.\nClick Video on My PC to open the Insert Video dialog box. In the Insert\nVideo dialog box, browse to and select the video file, and then click the\nInsert button.\n\n273\n\n\fChapter 8: Add sound and movement to slides\n\nTo select an embedded video\n1. Click the video image one time. Selection handles appear around the video\nimage, the playback toolbar appears below it, and the Video Tools tab group\nappears on the ribbon.\nTo move the video image on the slide\n1. Select the video, and then do either of the following:\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\nDrag the video to the new location. Smart guides might appear on the slide\nto help you align the video with other objects.\nPress the arrow keys to move the video by small amounts.\n\nTo resize the video image on the slide and retain its aspect ratio\n1. Do either of the following:\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\nDrag any corner handle. Smart guides appear on the slide to help you align\nthe video with other objects.\nOn the Format tool tab, in the Size group, set a specific Video Height or\nVideo Width, and then press Enter to change both settings.\n\nTo format the video image on the slide\n1. Select the video, and then apply formatting from the Format tool tab just as\nyou would for a picture.\nSEE ALSO For information about formatting pictures, see \u201cEdit and format\npictures\u201d in Chapter 6, \u201cInsert and manage simple graphics.\u201d\n\nTo configure an embedded video to play back at full screen size\n1. Select the video.\n2. On the Playback tool tab, in the Video Options group, select the Play Full\nScreen check box.\n\n274\n\n\fCompress media to decrease file size\n\nTo set the relative volume of a video soundtrack\n1. Select the video.\n2. On the Playback tool tab, in the Video Options group, click the Volume button.\n3. In the Volume list, click Low, Medium, High, or Mute.\n\nCompress media to decrease file size\nTrimming an audio or video clip affects only the playback of the media on the slide,\nnot the original media clip. The original media clip is stored in its entirety as part of\nthe presentation, and you can re-trim or restore the media clip at any time.\nYou can decrease the size of a PowerPoint file that contains trimmed media clips by\ndiscarding the unused portions of the clips. PowerPoint 2016 offers three compression\nconfigurations designed to balance size and quality.\n\n8\n\nChoose the size and quality that best fits your needs\n\nWhen you save and close the file after compressing the media, the trimmed portions\nof the videos are discarded and no longer available. You can reverse the compression\noperation until you save and close the file.\n\n275\n\n\fChapter 8: Add sound and movement to slides\n\nHyperlink to additional resources\nPresentations often include URLs of websites that provide additional information related to the presentation topic. When a presentation will be viewed\nelectronically, the URLs can be formatted as hyperlinks so that the websites\ncan be accessed directly from the presentation. Hyperlinks can also provide\naccess to information that might be on a hidden slide in the presentation, or\nin a separate file.\nTIP If you use Microsoft Outlook, you can also use a hyperlink to open an\nemail message window so that people viewing the presentation can easily\ncontact you.\nHyperlinks are most frequently in text format, but you can attach a hyperlink\nto any object\u2014for example, an image such as a shape, logo, or picture. Clicking\nthe hyperlinked object then takes you directly to the linked location. Editing\nthe object does not disrupt the hyperlink; however, deleting the object also\ndeletes the hyperlink.\nThe simplest method of creating a hyperlink is to enter a URL in a text box\nand then press the Enter key. PowerPoint automatically inserts the hyperlink\nand formats the URL so that people recognize it as a hyperlink.\nIf you want the same hyperlink to appear on every slide in a presentation,\nattach the hyperlink to text or an object on the presentation\u2019s master layout.\nFor information about slide masters, see \u201cCustomize slide masters and layouts\u201d in Chapter 12, \u201cCreate custom presentation elements.\u201d\n\n276\n\n\fCompress media to decrease file size\n\nTo attach a hyperlink to an object, follow these steps:\n1. Select the object that you want to hyperlink from.\n2. Open the Insert Hyperlink box by doing either of the following:\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\nOn the Insert tab, in the Links group, click Hyperlink.\n\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\nPress Ctrl+K.\n\n3. In the Link to list, click the type of target you\u2019re linking to. Often this is\na webpage or another place in the file.\n\n8\n\nYou can link to internal, local, and online locations\n\n4. If you\u2019re linking to a webpage, enter the URL in the Address box. If\nyou\u2019re linking to a slide or heading in the current file, click it in the\nSelect a place in this document pane. Then click OK.\n\n277\n\n\fChapter 8: Add sound and movement to slides\n\nTo compress media files\n1. Save the PowerPoint presentation, and then display the Info page of the Backstage view.\n\nInfo page of the Backstage view\n\n2. Note the total size of the presentation, the size of the media files in the presentation, and the number of files that have been trimmed.\n3. On the Info page, click the Compress Media button, and then click the level of\ncompression you want. In the Compress Media window, PowerPoint itemizes\nthe media elements and their compression levels, and reports the total space\nsavings.\n\nCompressing media files can make a big difference in file size\n\n278\n\n\fAdd and manage slide transitions\n\n4. In the Compress Media window, click the Close button. In the Media Size And\nPerformance area of the Info page, the Compress Media button is active to\nindicate that media has been compressed, and specifics about the compression\nare available.\n\nYou can undo the compression if you don\u2019t like the results\n\n5. Play the presentation to assess the quality, and then save the file if the quality is\nacceptable.\nTo reverse the compression of media files\n\n8\n\n1. On the Info page, click the Compress Media button, and then click Undo.\n\u00adPowerPoint immediately reverts to the uncompressed files.\n\nAdd and manage slide transitions\nWhen you deliver a presentation, you can manually specify when to display the next\nslide, or you can have PowerPoint move automatically to the next slide after a specific\namount of time. Rather than simply replacing one slide with the next, you can use\ntransitions to control the way each slide appears on the screen.\nPowerPoint 2016 has 48 basic transition effects divided into three categories: Subtle,\nExciting, and Dynamic Content. Many of these have multiple options, such as the\ndirection or specific form of the content in the effect.\n\n279\n\n\fChapter 8: Add sound and movement to slides\n\nPowerPoint has a wide variety of slide transition effects\n\nAs with animations, take care when using transitions to not overdo it. That being\nsaid, transitions can be a useful way of visually drawing the audience\u2019s attention to\nthe display of a new slide. The effects in the Subtle category are designed to make the\nincoming slide content available to the audience members with the least amount of\nmovement.\nHere are some ideas about other ways to use transitions:\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nIn a multisection presentation, use one transition on all the slides, and then use\na different transition at the beginning of each new section of the presentation\nto signal a change in topic.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\n\nUse a more dramatic slide transition to get the audience\u2019s attention at a specific\npoint in a presentation.\n\nYou apply and manage transition effects by using the commands on the Transitions\ntab of the ribbon. The basic transition effects are available from the Transition To This\nSlide gallery. If you apply a transition that has additional options, the Effect Options\n\n280\n\n\fAdd and manage slide transitions\n\nbutton becomes active and you can choose an option from the list. You can specify\nthe duration of the transition effect, or add a sound effect if you want to.\n\nOptions are available for many transition effects\n\nTIP You can add a sound effect even when the Transition is set to None. If you do, the\nsound effect plays during the normal slide replacement.\n\n8\n\nYou can apply a transition effect or configure effect options for one slide at a time, for\na group of slides, or for an entire presentation by first selecting the slide or slides you\nwant to work with. (You can also apply and configure a transition effect on one slide\nand then apply that effect to all slides.) When you apply a transition effect or select an\neffect option, PowerPoint immediately demonstrates it.\nAs mentioned in \u201cAnimate text and pictures on slides\u201d earlier in this chapter, PowerPoint\ndisplays a star next to the slide thumbnail to indicate that a slide has an animation or\ntransition. (There is no indication on the slide itself.) In the Thumbnails pane or in Slide\nSorter view, you can click the star to preview the animated slide elements beginning\nwith the transition.\nEvery transition effect has a default duration of between 0.1 seconds and 6 seconds\nbased on the complexity of the effect; most are from 1 to 2 seconds. You can change\nthe duration of an effect so that the animation completes in less or more time. The\nduration is specified in seconds and can be from a minimum of .01 seconds to a maximum of 59 seconds.\n\n281\n\n\fChapter 8: Add sound and movement to slides\n\nPowerPoint displays the slide timing next to the thumbnail\n\nWhen you configure a transition, it affects the entrance of the slide. You can\u2019t specifically configure an exit transition, but some of the transitions have an effect on the exit\nof the preceding slide. You can, however, configure whether the move to the next slide\nis manually initiated or happens automatically after the slide has been displayed for a\nspecific length of time (which can be from 0.01 seconds to just under 24 minutes).\nSEE ALSO For more information about slide timings, see \u201cRehearse a presentation and\nset slide timings\u201d in Chapter 10, \u201cPrepare and deliver presentations.\u201d\n\nTo select slides to apply or configure transitions\n1.

In Intermediate PowerPoint, we will learn to add custom effects to these\nslide elements and how to add tables, charts, diagrams, motion clips, sound clips, and\nhyperlinks to slides. We will also learn how to customize these slide elements to suit\nour needs.\nTo begin, open Microsoft PowerPoint and create several new slides in the blank\npresentation layout by using the New Slide command in the Slides group on the Home\ntab.\n1. Click on your first blank slide.\n2. Click on the Insert tab. A new tab will open displaying different options: Picture,\nClip Art, etc. You should see the following tabs when you click on INSERT:\n\nFeel free to add more slides as you need them throughout the class.\n\nCreating Custom Slide Effects\nIn the introduction class, we created basic slides with text boxes and clip art. A great\nway to add interest to these elements is through the use of custom effects.\nEffects are special sounds or animations that accompany the entrance or exit of content\non your slides. Effects help to make your presentations more lively and interesting.\nCustomizing effects\nTo customize the effect for a slide element:\n1. Click on the slide you want to change from the slide pane on the left.\n2. Click on the Animations tab.\n\nMain Library Computer Learning Center,\n\n2\n\n\f3. In the Animations group click Custom Animation. A panel will open on the right\nside of the screen showing and gray boxes with numbers will appear on your\nslide corresponding with the different slide elements on the slide.\n\n4. Click on the gray box next to the slide element that you want to add an\nanimation to. In the panel on the right side of the page, you will now notice\nseveral animation options that you can change to customize how each slide\nelement is displayed.\n5. Click Change at the top left of the animation pane to apply a\npremade slide effect to the chosen slide element.\n6. To further customize the animation of that element, choose\nthe animation options under the heading Modify: that you\nwould like to change for that slide element. Clicking Remove\nwill remove any animations from that element.\n7. Click Play at the bottom of the pane to preview how your\nanimation will appear on the slide.\n8. Follow steps 3 through 6 to change the effects of other\nelements on the slide.\n9. When you\u2019re done modifying the slide click another slide from\nthe Outline Pane or the click the Home tab to finish modifying\nyour effects.\n\nMain Library Computer Learning Center,\n\n3\n\n\fAdding and Customizing Tables\nCreating a new table\n1. Click on the slide you would like to add a table to.\n2. On the Insert tab click on Table at the far left side of the\nRibbon.\n3. You can create the different numbers of rows and columns\nby moving your mouse over the different blank squares. Your\ntable will be previewed on your slide.\n4. Click your left mouse button when your table is the size you\nwant.

It is a good idea to create a slide master before you start to build individual slides, rather\nthan after.\na. When you create the slide master first, all of the slides that you add to your\npresentation are based on that slide master.\nb. However, if you create a slide master after you start to build individual slides,\nsome of the items on the slides may not conform to the slide master design.\n2. To work with slide masters, go to the View tab and choose Slide Master.\n\na. A shortcut for getting to the Slide Master view is to hold the Shift key while\nclicking the Normal View button in the status bar in the lower right corner of the\nwindow.\n\n3. What you now see is not the content of the slides, but rather the layout of the slides. The\nslide thumbnails that appear on the left side of the window are slide masters for each of\nthe different layouts available.\n\nInformation Technology Services, UIS\n\n1\n\n\f[Not for Circulation]\n\n4. Changes made to any of the slide masters will apply to all slides of that layout (both\nthose that are already created as well as any future slides).\n\nThis logo will appear at\nthe top of each slide that\nuses this layout.\n\nInstead of the standard bullets, this\npresentation will use musical notes.\n\n5. To close the Slide Master view, click Close Master View on the Slide Master tab.\n\nTips for Running Presentations\n1. Start strong. The audience will give you merely 2-3 minutes to engage them. Don\u2019t\nwaste that time.\n2. Explain when you will entertain questions \u2013 at any time throughout the presentation or\nonly at the end.\n3. As you navigate through the slides, pause as each slide appears, thus giving the\naudience a chance to read and digest the slide before you start talking. Your speech\nshould amplify the slide content \u2013 you should never read a slide to the audience.\n4. There are multiple ways to navigate the slides:\na. Advancing a slide\ni. Click the mouse\nii. \u2018Enter\u2019 on the keyboard\niii. \u2018N\u2019 on the keyboard (for Next)\niv. The \u2018arrow down\u2019 key\nv. The \u2018arrow right\u2019 key\nvi.

The \u2018Home\u2019 key takes you to the first slide\n5. Utilize PowerPoint\u2019s highlighting and pen features to emphasize a point.\na. While presenting, right-click and choose Pointer Options.\n\ni.\nii.\niii.\niv.\nv.\n\nArrow is the default option.\nBallpoint Pen allows you to draw with a fine pen.\nFelt Tip Pen allows you to draw with a thicker pen.\nHighlighter allows you to draw with a thick pen.\nInk Color allows you to change the color of your drawing tool.\n1. There are several colors to choose from, including colors that\ncomplement your theme.\nb. Press the \u2018E\u2019 button on your keyboard to erase your drawings during the\npresentation.\nc. When you are finished with the presentation, you will have an option to keep or\ndiscard your drawings. Keep saves the drawings so that they will appear the\nnext time you present the slideshow. Discard removes the drawings.\n\nInformation Technology Services, UIS\n\n3\n\n\f[Not for Circulation]\n\n6. To refocus the audience\u2019s attention on you instead of your slide, use the \u2018B\u2019 button on\nthe keyboard to turn the screen black. Or use the \u2018W\u2019 button on the keyboard to turn\nthe screen white. Press the button again to return to your slide.\n7. Use a remote mouse when possible so that you are not tied to the front of the room.\n\nUsing Animation\nAnimation applied to text or objects in your presentation gives them sound or visual effects,\nincluding movement. You can use animation to focus on important points, to control the flow of\ninformation, and to increase viewer interest in your presentation.\nTo apply built-in animation,\n1. Select the text or object that you want to animate.\n2. Go to the Animations tab, in the Animations group, and select the animation effect that\nyou want from the Animate list.\n\nTo gain more control over how and when effects are applied, you can create and apply a custom\nanimation. You can apply more than one animation, so you can make a line of text fly in, and\nthen make the text fly out. Custom animations are created in the Custom Animation task pane.\nTo apply a custom animation,\n1. Select the text or object that you want to animate.\n\nInformation Technology Services, UIS\n\n4\n\n\f[Not for Circulation]\n\n2.

Click the Add Effect button and select an effect.\n\na. There are four types of effects:\ni. Entrance \u2013 Use to make the text or object enter the screen\nii. Emphasis \u2013 Use to add an effect to text or objects already visible on the\nscreen\niii. Exit \u2013 Use to make the text or object leave the screen\niv. Motion Paths \u2013 Use to make the text or object move in a specified\npattern\nb. Icons indicate the type of effect chosen.\n\n4. The timing of the animation effects can be modified. Choices include:\na. Start On Click \u2013 The animation effect begins when you click the slide\nb. Start With Previous \u2013 The animation effect begins at the same time as the\nprevious effect\nc. Start After Previous \u2013 The animation effect begins immediately after the\nprevious effect finishes playing\n\nInformation Technology Services, UIS\n\n5\n\n\f[Not for Circulation]\n\n5. The speed of the effect can be adjusted as well.\n\n6. Right-click the custom animation effect and then click Effect Options to specify how\nthe effect is applied to the text or object.\n\nIncorporating Multimedia\nPowerPoint allows you to insert sound or movie clips into your presentations. To prevent\npossible problems with links, it is a good idea to copy the sounds or videos into the same\nfolder as your presentation before they are added to the presentation.\nTo insert sound on a slide,\n1. On the Insert tab, in the Media Clips group, click the arrow under Sound.\n\n2. Do one of the following:\na.

If you have already saved\nthe file, such that it has a name and a location, the Save feature will keep any changes that made since\nthe document was opened.\nTo save a file:\n\u2010 From the File tab, choose Save\n\u2010 Click on the Save button on the Quick Access Toolbar (\n\u2010 Use the shortcut key Ctrl\u2010S.\n\n)\n\nSave As\nIf you want to save your file with a different name and/or location, click on the File tab, choose Save\nAs\u2026 or press the function key F12. If you have never saved this document before, any method you\nchoose to save will activate the Save As dialog box.\n\u2010 Word Document\u2010Saves as a Word Document (*.docx)\n\u2010 To save the file in a different format, change the Save As type option\nRemember if the file was previously saved, you will make a new copy by using \"Save As\u2026\".\nThe default file location is set in the Word Options. You can change this under the File tab, Options,\nSave, Default File Location.\nThe two most important things to remember with saving a file are:\n1. Where is the file being saved?\n2. What are you naming the file?\n\nPage 5\n\n\fClosing a Document\nTo close a file, from the File tab Close, or use one of the shortcut keys\n(Ctrl\u2010F4, or Ctrl\u2010W).\nIf you click the X in the top right\u2010hand corner of the window it will close the\ncurrent document. If it is the only document open, it will exit Word.\nIf there have been no changes to the document, Word will simply close the\nfile, but if you have made modifications since the document was opened,\ncreated, or last saved, Word will prompt you to save.\n\n\u2010\n\nIf you choose Save \u2010Word will save the document with the same name\ninto the same location, it previously had. If this file has never been saved,\nWord will open the SaveAs window. (The Enter key will push this button.)\n\n\u2010\n\nIf you choose Don\u2019t Save \u2010Word will close the window and you will lose any changes since the last\ntime the document was saved.\n\n\u2010\n\nIf you choose Cancel \u2010Word will forget that you asked it to close the file and place you back in the\ndocument. (The Esc key will push this button.)\n\nUndo, Redo and Repeat\nWord keeps track of most tasks you perform until you exit. Tasks such as formatting and deleting, can\nbe undone. From the Quick Access Toolbar click the button ( ), or use the shortcut key Ctrl\u2010Z.\nMost windows programs have an Undo feature; many only allow you to\nundo one task. Word keeps track of each step that you have done since\nthe document was opened.\nThere is a drop\u2010down arrow next to the Undo button, on the standard\ntoolbar. This allows you to see a list of every step you\u2019ve done so far. If\nyou want to undo something that you have done several steps ago, you\nhave to undo every step between now and then. You cannot go back and\nundo a single task without undoing everything back to that point.\nIf you undo too far, or you change your mind about the undoing of that task, Word allows you to Redo.\nOn the Quick Access Toolbar you will find the redo button ( ), or use the shortcut key Ctrl\u2010Y.\nIf there is nothing to redo, Word puts a Repeat feature in Redo\u2019s place (\nkey (Ctrl\u2010Y) to Repeat.\nPage 6\n\n) and assigns the shortcut\n\n\fCut, Copy and Paste\nCut, Copy and Paste are clipboard features built into windows. The clipboard\nis a temporary storage location where an item is stored for later recall. The\nwindows clipboard can only store one item at a time. Microsoft Office has a\nMulti\u2010Clipboard that can store 24 items. No matter how many items are in\nthe Office clipboard, the Paste button and shortcut key (Ctrl\u2010V) will only\nrespond to the most recently copied item. The clipboard must be displayed to\nbe able to use this feature. Items are stored with the copy and cut features,\nand recalled with the paste feature. You can open the multi\u2010clipboard from the \"more\" button.\nCut will copy the selected text to the clipboard and remove it from the current location. This\nbutton appropriately shows a pair of scissors for the cut option. The shortcut key is Ctrl\u2010X. To\nuse the Cut command you need to select the text or object you wish to move then choose the\noption. Move the cursor where you want the text or object to appear, and choose Paste.\n\u2010 Move: Instead of Cut/Paste, try selecting the text, then click and dragging to a new location.\nCopy will place the selected text on the clipboard; nothing will appear to happen on the\nwindow. The button shows two sheets of paper for the copy option. The shortcut key is Ctrl\u2010C.\nTo use the Copy command you need to select the text or object, and then choose copy. Move\nthe cursor where you want the text or object to appear, and choose Paste.\n\u2010 Duplicate: Instead of Copy/Paste, try selecting the text, and then drag to a new location\nwhile holding down the Ctrl key. Be sure to let go of the mouse before you let go of the\nkeyboard, and you will produce a duplicate.\nPaste will produce the last option copied or cut to the clipboard. This button shows a sheet of\npaper coming from a clipboard for the paste option. The shortcut key is Ctrl\u2010V, or Shift\u2010Insert.\nYou can usually paste the same item over and over again, until the computer has been\nrestarted or you copy/cut something else.\n\u2010 Paste Special: The drop down menu under the Paste button shows the Paste Special\noptions. These options will change depending on what is currently in the clipboard. It can be\na very useful tool to do things such as Paste as unformatted text. Unformatted text will get\nrid of hidden HTML codes from a webpage or the hidden formatting from another Word\nDocument.\nThe Format Painter will copy the format of selected text and apply it to the\ntext you specify. This button shows a paintbrush for the format painter option.\nTo use the Format Painter command you need to first select the text that has\nthe format you wish, click once on the button (a paintbrush will follow your\nmouse pointer), click on the text you want to reformat. This tool turns itself off\nafter each use. To turn it on, and keep it on, double\u2010click on the button on the\nstandard toolbar. To turn it back off, simply click on that button again or press\nescape (Esc).\n\nPage 7\n\n\fFormat Font\nMost options to change the format of the text can be found on the Home tab, in the Font group.\n1\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n2\n\n10\n\n11\n\n3\n\n12\n\n4\n\n13\n\n5\n\n14\n\n6\n\n15 16\n\n1.

Spelling errors include capitalization of certain proper nouns.\n\nAs you right\u2010click on each possible error, Word gives you a choice of possible changes. If you feel the\nword is not a mistake, you can tell it to Ignore All. If it's a word you will use often, you should be able\nto add it to your dictionary.\n\nWord usually only picks up one grammar error at a time, since as you change part of the sentence, it\ncould change the context. After each change, you may need to wait a few seconds, or click in another\nline for it to reevaluate your sentence.\nNeeds a comma\u2026\nCapitalization error\u2026\nBut of course no tool is perfect, what I meant to say was RAIN.\n\nHide Errors\nYou can correct the marked \"errors\" as they appear, or later when\nyou proof read, or never! The correction underlines don't printout.\nIf you would like to stop Word from showing you the misspellings,\nyou can turn them off for this document, or for all Word files from\nthe Word Options. Open the File Menu. Near the bottom of the\nmenu choose Options. Open the Proofing tab. Near the bottom of\nthe list you'll find the Word Spell Check options.\nThe Exceptions are to ignore spelling in THIS Word file.\nPage 13\n\n\fWhether you show the errors or not, sometimes it's easier to check everything when you're done. You\ncan use the Spelling & Grammar check on the Review tab, or press F7 on the keyboard. Word will open\na Spelling pane along the side of the window. This tool not only offers suggested changes, but gives a\nmore in\u2010depth look at your word usage, often including definitions.\n\nPage 14\n\n\fThesaurus\nOne of my favorite tools when I'm writing is the thesaurus. You can find it next\nto the Spelling and grammar button on the Review tab, or by pressing Shift\u2010F7\non the keyboard. This can cut down on over usage of the same word.\nI would like to find a good example to show you. For\nexample, \"the rain in Spain.\" Another good example might\nbe, \"how now brown cow.\"\nClick inside the word you want to look up and open the thesaurus. It will look\nup the word and give you a list of options if it can find any.\nWhen you click on the word in the list, Excel will look up that word instead,\ngiving you another list of words to consider. Usually this leads me to rewriting\npart of the sentence, but I like to think it comes out better.\nI would like a sample set of text to show you. For example,\n\"the rain in Spain.\" Another useful phrase might be, \"how\nnow brown cow.\"\nAutoCorrect\n\nWord often autocorrects words as you type. There are common mistakes like \"teh\" instead of \"the\"\nwhere you may not even notice it happen. If you catch it, you can immediately hit undo (or Ctrl\u2010Z) and\nit will go back to the way you typed the word. If it turns out that teh is an acronym for \"total education\nhealthcare\" and you want to use it all the time, you might choose to turn off that particular auto\u2010\ncorrection. Open the File Menu. Near the bottom of the menu choose Options. Open the Proofing tab.\nClick on the AutoCorrect Options\u2026 button.\nIf I want to remove teh from the Autocorrect, I\ntype it in the replace box and it will find the listing\nfor me. I can then use the Delete button to remove\nit from being autocorrected again. If you have\nwords you commonly misspell, you can add your\nown to this list.\n\nOne option I always turn off, is shown here on the\noptions window, \"Ignore words in UPPERCASE\". I\ndon't type in all caps often, but when I do, I need\nmy spell check!\nPage 15\n\n\f", "Microsoft Word Basics\n\n\fGetting Started\n\u25cf\n\nOpen word.

Introduction into word\nMicrosoft Word is a word-processing application that can be part of the Microsoft\nOffice suite or a stand-alone program installed on to your computer.\nThe program can be used to write letters and different types of documents that can\ninclude graphics and pictures. This guide explains how to create a document, how to\nselect text in a document, how to change text size and font, how to print a document\nand how to save a document.\n\nIt will feature Word 2010 for PCs. A word processor included free with the Windows\noperating system is WordPad, which doesn\u2019t have all the features of Word but does\nhave some formatting features.\n\n2. How to create a document\nIt can be found in the \u2018Start\u2019 menu under \u2018Microsoft Office\u2019. Click on 'All programs'\nand then scroll to 'Microsoft Office' folder\n\n1\n\n\fYou\u2019ll need: A computer with Microsoft Word installed. Follow these step-by-step\ninstructions to create a document in Microsoft Word\n\nStep 1: From the desktop or\n\nfrom your \u2018Start\u2019 menu, open Microsoft Word by clicking on \u2018All programs\u2019 then\nnavigating through to Microsoft word 2010 as below:\n\nStep 2: Microsoft Word will open up and present a blank document ready for you to\nstart typing.\n\nStep 3: The flashing cursor (mouse pointer) in the document tells you where you\u2019re\ntyping. Wherever the flashing cursor is placed, the letters that you type will be\n\n2\n\n\finserted at that point. When you start a blank document, the flashing cursor will be at\nthe start of your document ready for you to start typing.\n\nStep 4: As you type, the cursor will also move with each letter. This guides you so\nthat you know where the focus is for typing.\n\nStep 5: The mouse can be used for moving around a document. When the mouse\npointer is moved over a text area, the pointer will change from an arrow to a \u2018text\nselect\u2019 or \u2018I-beam\u2019 icon.\n\n3\n\n\fStep 6: Move the text select/mouse pointer with your mouse to where you would like\nto change or add text. Click the left-hand mouse button. This will then place the\nflashing cursor at the point where you have clicked so that you can edit or insert text.\nStep 7: You can also move around your document using the arrow keys on the\nkeyboard.\n\nStep 8: Pressing these arrow keys will move the flashing cursor up a line of text,\ndown a line or left one character or right one character. Using a combination of\nkeystrokes can also move the cursor further \u2013 e.g. holding down the Ctrl (control)\nkey and pressing the left arrow key will move the cursor left one word. Holding down\nCtrl and pressing the up arrow key will move the cursor to the start of each\nparagraph.\n\n3. How to select text in a document\nStep 1: If you are not already in a Word document, you will need to open it. From the\ndesktop or from your \u2018Start\u2019 menu, open Microsoft Word.\nStep 2: Click \u2018File\u2019 button in the top left. Select Open and browse to the document\nyou wish to open. Double-click on the file name to open.\n\n4\n\n\fStep 3: The mouse can be used to select text. When the mouse pointer is moved\nover a text area, the pointer will change from an arrow to a \u2018text select\u2019 or \u2018I-beam\u2019\nicon.\nStep 4: Move the text select/mouse pointer with your mouse to where you\u2019d like to\nstart your selection. Click and hold down the left mouse button. While doing this,\nmove the mouse across your text to where you\u2019d like the selection to stop. As you\nmove the mouse, the text will be selected. When you\u2019ve finished your selection,\nrelease the left mouse button.\n\nStep 5: The selected text can now be formatted or changed if required.\nStep 6: You can also move and select text using the arrow keys on the keyboard,\nwhich some people may find easier than the mouse.\nIf you use a combination of keyboard keys \u2013 e.g. holding down Ctrl and Shift and\npressing the left or right arrow key \u2013 you can move the cursor and select the text in\ndifferent directions.\nStep 7: Once text is selected (highlighted), it can be changed or edited as required.\n\n5\n\n\f4. How to change text size and font\nStep 1: Open an existing Word document or start a new document and type your\ntext.\nStep 2: If you\u2019d like to change a portion of the text to a different font, it will need to be\nselected or highlighted first. When the mouse pointer is moved over a text area, it will\nchange from an arrow to a \u2018text select\u2019 or \u2018I-beam\u2019 icon.\nStep 3: Select your text so that it\u2019s highlighted.\n\nStep 4: To change the font style, click the arrow next to the font style in the ribbon at\nthe top of your document.\n\nStep 5: Choose your font style from the drop-down list given\nStep 6: Next to the font style box is a box containing a number and an arrow. This\nchanges the size of the font. Click on the arrow\nStep 7: Choose the size of font from the drop-down list of options\n\n6\n\n\fStep 8: If you\u2019d like the same size and style of font set up every time you start a new\ndocument, you can set a \u2018default font\u2019. Click on the \u2018Font\u2019 arrow just above the main\nscreen.\n\nStep 9: A dialogue box will pop up. In this, choose your font size and style from the\noptions\nStep 10: Click Set as Default in the bottom left-hand corner of the dialogue box.\n\n7\n\n\fStep 11: Another dialogue box will pop up asking if you\u2019re sure you want to change\nthe font for all Word documents. Click Yes. Now, whenever you open a new\ndocument in Word, the default font will be used.\n\n5. How to print a document\nTo print a document, your computer needs to be connected to a printer.\nStep 1: Open an existing Word document or start a new document and type your\ntext.\nStep 2: Once you\u2019ve completed your document and are ready to print, click \u2018File\u2019 in\nthe top left-hand corner.\n\nStep 3: Move down and click \u2018print\u2019 in the menu. This will bring up the \u2018Print\u2019 dialogue\nbox.\n\n8\n\n\fStep 4: Choose how many copies of your document you need.\n\nStep 5: Depending on your printer options, you can choose other printing features\nsuch as whether you want to print all pages or only certain pages. You can also\nchange the orientation of the print from portrait to landscape and tell your computer\nand printer whether you\u2019re printing on a certain size of paper. You\u2019ll also see, on the\nright, a preview of your printed document will look like.\n\n9\n\n\fStep 6: When you\u2019re happy with your settings, click \u2018Print\u2019. The document will now\nstart printing on your printer.\n\n6. How to save a document\nIt is good practice to regular save your document as you are working on it. This\nmeans that your document will be backed up on the computer in case your computer\ninexplicitly shuts down which would result in losing your document if it is not saved.\nThere are several ways to save a document in word. The following instructions will\ntake you through the different options.\nStep 1: If you are saving a document for the first time, on the \u2018Quick Access Toolbar\u2019,\nclick \u2018Save\u2019\n\n, or press \u2018CTRL+S.\u2019\n\n10\n\n\fStep 2: Type a name for the document, and then click \u2018Save\u2019. Word saves the\ndocument in a default location. To save the document in a different location, select\nanother folder in the list of folders.\n\n11\n\n\fSave an existing document as a new document (Save As)\nTo prevent overwriting the original document, use the \u2018Save As\u2019 command to create\na new file as soon as you open the original document.\nStep 1: Open the document that you want to save as a new file.\nStep 2: Click the \u2018File\u2019 tab.\nStep 3: Click \u2018Save As\u2019.\n\nStep 4: Type a name for the document, and then click \u2018Save\u2019.\n\n12\n\n\fStep 5: Word saves the document in a default location. To save the document in a\ndifferent location, click another folder in the \u2018Save in\u2019 list (down the left hand side) in\nthe \u2018Save As\u2019 dialog box. If you want to change the default location where Word\nsaves documents, adjust settings for saving documents.\n\nAdjust settings for saving documents\nStep 1: Click the \u2018File\u2019 tab.\nStep: 2 Under \u2018Help\u2019 click \u2018Options\u2019.\n\n13\n\n\fStep 3: Click \u2018Save\u2019.\n\nStep 4: In the \u2018Save files in this format box\u2019, click the file format that you want to use.\n\n14\n\n\fStep 5: Next to the \u2018Default file location\u2019 box, click \u2018Browse\u2019, and then click the folder\nwhere you want to save your files.\n\nThese options control the default behavior the first time that you use the \u2018Open\u2019,\n\u2018Save\u2019, or \u2018Save As\u2019 command when you start Word. Whenever you save a\ndocument, you can override these settings by specifying a different location or format\nin the \u2018Open\u2019, \u2018Save\u2019, or \u2018Save As\u2019 dialog box.\n\n15\n\n\f", "Page |1\n\nIntermediate Microsoft Word 2010\nABOUT THIS CLASS\n\nThis class is designed to continue where the Microsoft Word 2010 Basics class left off. Specifically, we will cover\nadditional formatting and image use as well as creating, stylizing, and editing tables. It is impossible in these two hours\nto become totally proficient using Microsoft Word, but it is my hope that this class will provide added skills to further\nlaunch you into this exciting world!\n\nCourse Objectives\nBy the end of this course, you will:\n\uf0fc Have a substantial knowledge of formatting, including use of the Paragraph and Style groups.\n\uf0fc Know how to create, format, and edit a table.\n\uf0fc Know how to add, format, and sort table data.\n\uf0fc Be able add screen shots and web images to your document.\n\uf0fc Know how to crop, resize, place, and edit images.\n\nThis booklet will serve as a guide as we progress through the class, but it can also be a valuable tool for when you are\nworking on your own. Any class instruction is only as effective as the time and effort you are willing to invest in it. I\nencourage you to practice soon after we have completed the class. There will be additional computer classes in the near\nfuture, and I am always available for questions during Tech Tuesdays. Tech Time is usually Tuesdays from 3-5 pm and\nThursdays from 3-5 pm. Feel free to call to confirm.\nRemember that the library has many additional books and resources to help you. Never hesitate to ask any of the Sisson\nLibrary staff to locate resources for you.\n\nMeg Wempe, Adult Services Librarian\n\n\fPage |2\n\n\u201cFormatting Beyond the Font:\u201d Using the Paragraph & Style Groups\nParagraph Group\nIn Word 2010 Basics, we learned how to create and format bulleted and number lists. However, there are numerous\nother format options located in the Paragraph group:\nBullets\n\nNumbering\n\nMultilevel List\n\nAlignment Text Options\n\nDecrease/Increase Indent\n\nLine and Paragraph Spacing\n\nShading\n\nSort\n\nFormatting Symbols\n\nBottom Border\n\nExercise 1. Alignment\nLet\u2019s try out the Alignment buttons.\n1. Type this paragraph (or something of the sort):\nToday we\u2019re learning more about Word 2010. In this exercise, we\u2019re going to use the Alignment buttons in\nthe Paragraph group.\n2. Now highlight the paragraph. Notice that the Align Text Left button is highlighted, which is the default\nalignment. Click on the Center Text\n\nbutton. Notice that the paragraph then centers itself.\n\n3. Click on the following two buttons, Align Text Right and Justify. Notice that the text is aligned accordingly.\nJustify is even spacing across the entire page. In other words, the text is aligned both Left and Right, so spaces\nbetween letters and words are added or removed as necessary.\nTip: that there are also keyboard short cuts for alignment:\na. Left: Ctrl+L\nb. Center: Ctrl+E\nc. Right: Ctrl+R\nd. Justify: Ctrl+J\n\n\fPage |3\n\nStyle Group\nWord 2010 gives you access to a number of default styles at your fingertips in the Style group:\n\nThe styles listed above are called Quick Styles, since they allow one-click formatting. The default QuickStyle group is\nNormal, which includes 1.15 spaces between lines. Also easily accessible are Heading 1 and Heading 2 which are great\nfor Headings (1) and Sub-Headings (2). Other options are Subtitle, Subtle Emphasis, Emphasis, etc. These one-click\nstyles allow for speedy formatting.\nQuick Exercise: Highlight the sentence we wrote in the last exercise and try out the different styles.\nThe Default set of Quick Styles is just one style set available. To access additional styles sets, click on Change Styles:\n\nTip: You can change which styles are displayed in a style set or create your own. For instructions on how to do this, visit:\nhttp://www.shaunakelly.com/word/styles/quick-styles-gallery.html\n\n\fPage |4\n\nTables\nWord 2010 allows you to easily create and format a table. The Table options are located on the Insert tab.\n\nCreating a Table\nTo create a table, click on the Table button in the Tables Group:\n\nYou can then design your table via the Insert Table grid.\nExercise 2. Creating a 4x4 table\n1. Click the Table button.\n2. Use the grid to select a table that is 4x4:\n\n\fPage |5\n\nYou\u2019ll then have a table that looks like this:\n\nTable Styles\nOnce you\u2019ve selected your table, a Table Tools menu will pop-up:\n\nSimilar to the Style Groups, there are a number of one-click formatting options. To see additional options, click on the\ndown arrow in the lower left corner of the table styles menu:\n\nYou can also manually format your table by selecting different styles of borders and shading:\n\nFollow the same steps we used in Exercise 15 in the Word Basics class (Adding Shading or a Border to a Document) to\nedit your borders and/or shading.\nQuick Exercise: Take a few moments to try out different table styles and formats.\nTip: the Table Tools menu is a situational menu, which means that it is only accessible when you click on your table\n(otherwise it is hidden). If you wish to edit your table but do not see the Table Tools menu, click inside your table and it\nwill appear.\n\n\fPage |6\n\nMerging Table Cells\nSometimes it\u2019s necessary to remove\u2014called Merge in Word\u2014cells in your table (a good example of merging is creating a\nHeader row). To do this, highlight the cells that you wish to merge. Then click the Merge Cells button in the Merge\ngroup under the Table Tools>Layout tab. Or, you can right click and select Merge Cells from the menu.\nExercise 3. Merging Cells: Creating a Header Row\n1. Highlight the first row (all four cells)\n2. Right-click and select Merge Cells.\nYou\u2019ll now have a single cell at the top of your table:\n\nTip: You can merge cells vertically following the same steps\u2014just highlight a column or a set of cells in a vertical line\nand click Merge Cells.\n\nSplitting Table Cells\nThe opposite of merging cells is splitting. There is a Split Cells button in the Merge group under the Table Tools>Layout\ntab. Or, you can right click and select Split Cells from the menu. Let\u2019s reinstate the cells we just merged in Exercise 3.\nExercise 4. Splitting Cells\n1. Place your cursor and click inside the first (header) cell.\n2. Go to the Table Tools>Layout tab and click Split Cells.\n3. A box will appear that allows you to select the number of rows and columns you wish to create within this cell.\nIn our case we want 4 columns and 1 row:\n\n\fPage |7\n\nYou\u2019ll then have a table that, once again, looks like this:\n\nTip: Sometimes your cells will split unevenly (e.g. the column/row borders will not matchup). You can rearrange the cell\nspacing so that they are evenly distributed by highlighting the cells and clicking on Distribute Rows or Distribute\nColumns (depending on your need) in the Cell Size group under the Table Tools>Layout tab.\n\nModifying Cell Size\nYou can adjust the height and width of the cells two ways:\n1. By entering the physical dimensions (in inches).\n2. By manually clicking and dragging.\nExercise 5. Adjusting Cell Height and Width (physical dimensions)\n1. Highlight the entire table.\n2. Click the up button next to Height in the Cell Size group under the Table Tools>Layout tab until you reach 0.5\u201d\n(you can also type .5 in the dimension box).\n3. Click the up button next to Width in the Cell Size group under the Table Tools>Layout tab until you reach 2\u201d\n(you can also type 2 in the dimension box).\nYou\u2019ll then have a table that looks like this:\n\n\fPage |8\n\nExercise 6. Adjusting Cell Height and Width (click and dragging)\n1. Hover your cursor over the bottom border of the first row until you see this cursor icon:\n2. Click and drag to adjust the row height. Note that the physical dimensions are displayed on the left side of the\nscreen:\n\n3. Hover your cursor over the right border of the first column until you see this cursor icon:\n4. Click and drag to adjust the width. Note that the physical dimensions are displayed on the top of the screen:\n\nText Formatting Within Cells\nOne of the tricks with creating a legible and well organized table is formatting the text within the table cells. There are a\nnumber of tools in Word 2010 that make text formatting easy.\nBefore we proceed with our text formatting exercises, let\u2019s delete the table we\u2019ve been working with (highlight the\nentire table and click Backspace or Delete, or right-click and select Delete Table).\n\n\fPage |9\n\nThen create a 2x4 table:\n\nThen:\n1. Highlight the table and adjust the cell height size to .5\u201d.\n2. In the first column, enter these numbers in the cells from top to bottom: 2,1,4,3\n3. In the second column, enter these words in the cells from top to bottom: Apple, Banana, Peach, Orange.\nWhen you\u2019re finished, you should have a table that looks like this:\n2\n\nApple\n\n1\n\nBanana\n\n4\n\nPeach\n\n3\n\nOrange\n\n\fP a g e | 10\n\nText Alignment\nText alignment refers to the placement of the text within each cell. By default, Word 2010 aligns the text in the upper\nleft. You can change this by clicking on the various alignment buttons in the Alignment group under the Table\nTools>Layout tab:\n\nQuick Exercise: Highlight a cell (or the whole table if you\u2019d like) and then hover over the different alignment options to\nsee a preview of how they will re-align the text. When you\u2019ve found an alignment you like, select it.\n\nText Direction\nYou can also adjust the direction of the text using the Text Direction button:\n\nHighlight a cell (or the whole table if you\u2019d like) and then click the text direction button to see how the text direction\nshifts.\n\nAutoFit\nIf you\u2019d like to conserve table space and adjust the cell sizes so that they fit snuggly around your text (and don\u2019t leave\nany extra space), highlight the table and click AutoFit>AutoFit Content in the Cell Size group under the Table\nTools>Layout tab:\n\n\fP a g e | 11\n\n2 Apple\n\n1 Banana\n\n4 Peach\n\n3 Orange\n\nOnce you\u2019ve AutoFitted your table, if you add text to a cell, the table will automatically readjust (re-AutoFit, in fact). In\nthe bottom right cell, type Julius after Orange and you will see how the cell continues to AutoFit:\n2 Apple\n\n1 Banana\n\n4 Peach\n\n3 Orange Julius\n\n\fP a g e | 12\n\nSort\nIf the information in a column or row can be ordered (alphabetically or numerically), you can use the Sort feature to\nautomatically order the information.\nExercise 7. Sort\n1. Highlight the first column in the table (the column with numbers).\n2. Click Sort in the Data group under the Table Tools>Layout tab.\n3. Make sure Column 1 is listed in the first Sort By menu. If so, click OK.\n\nThe first column of the table will then be sorted numerically, and the second column will automatically reorder based on\nits association with the first column:\n1 Banana\n\n2 Apple\n\n3 Orange Julius\n\n4 Peach\n\n\fP a g e | 13\n\nMore Image (Picture) Features & Formatting\nIn Word 2010 Basics, we learned how to find and insert clip art into our document and how to resize it. Let\u2019s look at\nsome more ways to incorporate images into your Word 2010 documents.\nScreen Shots\nA screen shot is a picture of whatever is on your screen at any given moment. You can take a screen shot by pressing the\nPrint Screen button on your keyboard (usually in the upper right corner). This will then snap a photo of everything on\nyour screen.\nExercise 8. Taking a Screen Shot\n1. Press the Print Screen key.\n2. Place the cursor at the point in your document where you wish to place your screen shot.\n3. Then right-click and select Paste or press Ctrl-V.\nNotice that everything that was viewable on your screen when you took your screen shot is displayed, including your\nmenus, your desktop task bar, your system tray, etc. You can crop and edit your screen shot, so as to only display what\nyou wish.\n\nEditing Screen Shots (and Images)\nCropping\nOnce you have your screen shot on your document, you can crop (a.k.a. cut out) aspects of the screen shot you don\u2019t\nwish to include. Click on the screen shot, and the Picture Tools menu (which is a situational menu, like Table Tools) will\nappear.\nExercise 9. Cropping Your Screen Shot\n1. Click on the screen shot. Notice that the Picture Tools menu is displayed.\n2. Click on the Format tab under Picture Tools.\n3. Click Crop:\n\n4. The 8 crop handles around the screen shot will change to look like this:\ndrag. It will then crop accordingly.\n\nClick on one of the crop handles and\n\n\fP a g e | 14\n\nResizing\nOnce you\u2019ve cropped your screen shot, you can adjust the size and placement of the photo. We went over this process\nin Word 2010 Basics, so the below exercise is a refresher.\nExercise 10. Centering and Resizing Your Screen Shot\n1. Select the screen shot in the document by clicking on it. Handles appear at the corners and in the middle of each\nside.\n2. Center the screen shot while it is still selected. If you need to select the screen shot again, just click on it once.\nTo center it, click the Center button.\n3. Move your pointer to the bottom right corner handle until it changes to the Diagonal Resize shape.\nDragging\nwith a corner handle changes the width and height at the same time without changing the proportions of the\nscreen shot. Continue resizing until you are satisfied with the size.\n\nPositioning & Text Wrapping\nYou can also select a specific area of the page to place your screen shot. This is a useful tool when merging an image\n(screenshot or otherwise) with text.\nExercise 11. Positioning & Text Wrapping\n1. Open the Word document entitled Positioning and Text Wrapping.doc on your desktop.\n2. Minimize your documents and take a screen shot of your desktop background.\n3. Place the cursor somewhere in the middle of the page and paste the screen shot. Notice that it displaces all the\ntext and it is aligned left.\n4. Click on the screen shot and then click on Position menu in the Arrange group under the Picture Tools>Format\ntab:\n\n\fP a g e | 15\n\n5. Hover over the different options under With Text Wrapping, and notice how it places the photo and rearranges\nthe text accordingly. When you find a placement you like, select it.\nTip: There are more advanced Text Wrapping options you can explore. Click on the screen shot and then click on Wrap\nText menu in the Arrange group under the Picture Tools>Format tab.\n\nPicture Borders\nYou can also add a border to your screen shot.\nExercise 12. Adding a Border\n1. Click on your screen shot.\n2. Click on Picture Border in the Picture Style group under the Picture Tools>Format tab.\n3. You can then pick a Border Style (e.g.solid or dotted lines), Border Color, and Border Line Weight (a.k.a width).\nChoose whichever you\u2019d like!\n4. There are also a number of one-click formats in the Picture Style group under the Picture Tools>Format tab:\n\nTip: Every aspect of formatting we\u2019ve done with our screenshot can be used for any image, whether it\u2019s clip art, a photo\nyou\u2019ve taken, or a picture from the web.\n\n\fP a g e | 16\n\nFinding and Using Web Images\nYou can also search for images via the web to copy and paste into your document.\nExercise 13. Finding a Web Image and Adding It to Your Document\n1. Open a web browser and go to google.com.\n2. Select Images at the top of the webpage:\n\n3. Type \u201cdog\u201d and hit enter.\n4. Click on a photo that you like. Upon clicking, a preview of the photo will load.\n5. Right-click and select Copy Image:\n\n1\n\n1\n\nFrom: http://completedogfood.net/\n\n\fP a g e | 17\n\n6. Go to your word document (or open a new Blank Document), place the cursor at the point on the page you wish\nto paste your image, and then paste (Ctrl-V or right-click and select Paste) the image.\nYou can then use all of the style features we learned earlier to format your photo.\nTip: Most images on the web are copyrighted, so copying and pasting them into a word document can be a violation of\ncopyright. At the very least, you should cite the website you retrived your image from. You can find this by clicking on an\nimage. When the preview pops up, close it (click the X in the upper right corner). This will then take you to the website\nwhere this image is stored. Copy the web address of that site and use it in your citation.\nThere are also many websites that store images that are free and in the public domain.\n\nCongratulations!

In particular, it shows you the best way to write something like an essay. It\nshould bring undergraduates up to a level sufficient for their studies.\nThis document assumes that you are familiar with the layout of Word 2013 and can use the\nRibbon and its buttons, which are covered in the document Microsoft Word: An Essential Guide.\nIt also assumes you know about saving and printing your work.\n\nStarting up Microsoft Word\nTo start Microsoft Word:\n1. Load up Word 2013 as usual or press <Ctrl n> for a new document if Word is already open\nWARNING: Avoid opening files directly from a USB pen or similar media - first copy them to\nDocuments and then open them from there. Copy back to your media after editing.\nTip: You can create a shortcut to any file by right clicking on it and then choosing Send to followed by\nDesktop (create shortcut). To load the file in future, simply double click on the desktop icon. When\nyou\u2019ve finished working on it, <Delete> the shortcut \u2013 the file to which it refers is NOT deleted.\n2. Press <Ctrl s> to save your file (or click on the [Save] button on the Quick Access Toolbar or use\nSave on the FILE tab)\n3. Give your file a name (eg type testdoc) then press <Enter> for [Save]\nNote that your file has the file extension of .docx. Documents used to have the extension .doc,\nwhich was for the old Word 97-2003 format and you can save in this format if you need to by using\nSave As on the FILE tab.\n\nCreating a Title\nWhen starting a new document, the first thing you usually do is to type in a title. Titles need to\nstand out from the rest of the text. To achieve this, most people turn on bold and select a larger font\nsize (and then reset them after typing the title) but Word provides a facility to do this automatically.\n\nUsing Styles\nStyles -\n\nTurning on bold/italic/underline and changing fonts or font size explicitly is not the best way to\ncreate a title. In Microsoft Word you have different heading styles already set up for you:\n1. Click on the [Heading 1] button in the Styles group on the HOME tab of the Ribbon to create a\ntitle \u2013 you may find that a Navigation Pane appears on the left of the screen\n2. Type the title of your work - eg My Main Title\nThe text automatically appears in bold and in larger letters (the font is set to Calibri Light, the colour\nto blue and the size to 16 point).\nNote: Word also has a Title style \u2013 here the font size is much larger (28 point). Heading styles have\nother advantages, however, so stick to these.\n1\n\n\f3. Press <Enter> and the style automatically reverts back to Normal (Calibri font size 11pt)\nStyles are simply different types of formatted text. It is better to use them rather than setting up a\nparticular format manually for several reasons:\n\uf0b7\n\nYou don't have to keep clicking on the toolbar buttons to activate and de-activate the settings\n\n\uf0b7\n\nYou don't have to remember how different heading and sub-heading levels have been set up\n\n\uf0b7\n\nIf you alter a style, text defined in that style changes throughout the whole document\n\n\uf0b7\n\nYou can create your own styles\n\n\uf0b7\n\nMost importantly, heading styles are used to generate a Table of Contents automatically \u2013 this is\nvery important when you have to write a thesis or dissertation\n\nNote: In Word 2013 there is a new DESIGN tab which allows you to select a different style set, so that\nyou can change more than one style at a time. One of these style sets is for numbered headings.\n\nModifying a Style\nYou may not like the way the Heading 1 style has been set up. There are several ways to change this,\nthe easiest being as follows:\n1. Click three times on your heading (My Main Title) to select it\n2. Make the desired changes to the font \u2013 eg click on the drop-down arrow attached to the [Font\nColor] button and choose Automatic (ie black)\n3. Make any changes to the paragraph layout \u2013 eg click on the [Center] button\n4. Finally, right click on the [Heading 1] button on the HOME tab and choose Update Heading 1 to\nMatch Selection\nWhenever you use the Heading 1 style again in this document, the new settings will be used. Note\nthat this change only applies to this document \u2013 if you start up a new document the old Heading 1\nsettings are used. You\u2019ll see later how to change the default settings for all your documents.\n\nThe Body (Normal) Text\nYou next need to decide how you want the rest of your text to appear. It's easiest to set this up at the\nvery start of your text. You can then modify the Normal style setting, as you did with Heading 1.\n1. Move down to the end of your document (press <down arrow> or <Ctrl End>)\n2. Set up the required font \u2013 its size, colour and the font itself (eg change the size to 12 point)\n3. Next, have a look at the current paragraph settings - click on the group arrow in the bottom\nright corner of the Paragraph group on the Ribbon and the Paragraph window appears:\n\n2\n\n\fThe default setting for a Normal style paragraph in Word 2013 has the line spacing slightly greater\nthan single (1.08), with extra space separating one paragraph from the next (8pt after). This saves\nyou having to press <Enter> twice at the end of each paragraph. To change the spacing:\n4. Click on the list arrow under Line Spacing: and choose 1.5 lines (or Double for double spacing)\nTip: Note the option Exactly. This is useful if something doesn't quite fit neatly on a page. Instead of\nDouble, you could set a line spacing of exactly 1.9, for example, just for the paragraphs on that page.\nWhile the Paragraph window is still open, have a look at the options on the Line and Page Breaks tab:\n5. Click on the Line and Page Breaks tab\n\nCurrently, Widow/Orphan control is set on. This ensures you don't have a single line of a paragraph\nisolated from the rest when printing (at least two lines will be shown on the top/bottom of the page).\nNote also Keep with next, which keeps two paragraphs together. This is automatically turned on when\nyou use a heading style. The Asian Typography tab isn\u2019t relevant for most users (and may not even be\nshown).\n6. Press <Enter> for [OK] to close the Paragraph window\n7. Type some text to check that the settings are what you require\n8. Finally, right click on the [Normal] button on the HOME tab and choose Update Normal to Match\nSelection\nIt\u2019s important to change the style in this way and not just the layout for this particular paragraph.\nNote that you could have changed the line spacing and other paragraph settings using the buttons\non the Ribbon; the group arrow was used just to show you all the options which can be changed.\n9. [Save] your work \u2013 it\u2019s a good idea to save your work regularly (eg every 10 minutes or so)\nTip: Remember, the easiest way to do this is to press <Ctrl s> periodically.\n\nCreating a Style\nYou may want to create your own styles for particular pieces of work (for a quotation, for example):\n1. Press <Enter> for a new paragraph then type in a quotation (or a couple of lines of rubbish\ntext)\n2. Make the required changes to the layout of the paragraph \u2013 click on the Paragraph group arrow\nand change the Line spacing: to Single and the Left: and Right: Indentation to 1.0 cm (then click\non [OK])\n3. Make any required changes to the font \u2013 click three times within the paragraph to select it then\n(for example) press <Ctrl i> or click on [Italic] to make the text italic\n\n3\n\n\f4. After selecting the text, a Quick Format box should appear with the last button being for\nStyles\n\n5. Click on the above [Styles] button and choose Create a Style\n6. Type in a new name for your style - call this one quotation and press <Enter> for [OK]\n\nNow, every time you want to type in a quotation, simply select this style from the available styles.\nIn fact the style isn\u2019t quite correct yet as you\u2019ll discover if you try moving to a new paragraph:\n7. Press <End> (or <right arrow>) to move the typing position to the end of the quotation\n8. Press <Enter> for a new paragraph \u2013 the style stays as quotation (with a heading it reverted to\nnormal)\n9. Press <Backspace> or <Ctrl z> twice to remove the extra paragraph\nTo correct your quotation style:\n10. Right click on the new [quotation] button in the Styles group on the Ribbon and choose Modify...\nThe Modify Style dialog box appears:\n\n11. Click on the list arrow attached to Style for following paragraph: and choose Normal\nNote the options at the foot of the Modify Style window. The style modifications are currently set to\nOnly in this document. If, however, you select the option New documents based on this template, your\nstyle will be available in all your new documents. If you want this then turn this option on.\n12. Press <Enter> for [OK] to close the Modify Style dialog box\n13. Press <Enter> again and you should find the style now reverts to Normal\n4\n\n\fYou can modify the other style settings (Normal and Headings) in the same way via the Ribbon,\nadding them to the template if you wish to change the defaults.\nFinally, test your style on another paragraph:\n14. Click once on your normal paragraph - there is no need to select the paragraph\n15. Move the mouse over the [quotation] button and your paragraph will appear single spaced,\nitalicised and indented (there\u2019s no need to make it so)\n16. If you did accidentally apply the style, press <Ctrl z> or click on [Undo] to remove the style\nchange\n17. Press <Ctrl End> to move back to the end of your text\n\nThe Styles Pane\nYou may have noticed that the new quotation style has displaced another potentially useful style from\nthe Ribbon. What happens if you want a style that\u2019s disappeared? You can get to more styles either\nby using the scroll bar in the Styles group or by clicking on [More]\n(the button at the bottom of\nthe styles scroll bar). However, if you are using styles a lot then it\u2019s easier to display the Style Pane\npermanently.\n1. Try using the styles scroll bar then view all the styles by clicking on the [More] button\n2. Choose Heading 2 and type in a second heading \u2013 this style has also been set up in the\nCalibriLight font again with the colour blue and the size 13 point\n3. Modify the current settings, if you want, using either of the methods described earlier (either\nby right clicking on the [Heading 2] button and choosing Modify\u2026 or by changing the look of\nthe typed text, right clicking on the [Heading 2] button and choosing Update Heading 2 to\nMatch Selection)\nNext, display the Style Pane:\n4. Click on the group arrow in the bottom right corner of the Styles group \u2013 the Styles pane\nappears on the far right\n5. Click back on your quotation paragraph and then on the Normal style in the pane - the\ncurrent paragraph changes back to normal\nFor more information on styles see the Microsoft Word: Styles advanced notes.\nNote: In Word 2013, when you move to the left of a heading, you may notice a small arrow like so:\n\nClicking on the arrow will hide what appears under this heading. Clicking on the arrow again (it\nlooks slightly different) will show the content under the heading.\n\nThe Ruler\nThe Ruler was an integral part of Microsoft Word right up to Word 2007. In the later versions of the\nsoftware it isn\u2019t displayed by default but it can easily be turned back on. In fact, it shows you several\nimportant paragraph settings and can be used to set tab positions.\n\n5\n\n\fTo display the Ruler:\n1. Click on the VIEW tab on the Ribbon and then the [Ruler] button in the Show group (there\nshould now be a tick in the box next to Ruler)\n\nThe Ruler, which is marked up in centimetres, is used to set the layout of the text across the page,\nincluding margins, tab positions and indents. First line, hanging, left and right indents are shown by\nsymbols at each end of the white part of the ruler. Tabs are shown by various symbols depending on\ntheir type; the default tabs are set at 1.27cm (half inch) intervals.\n2. Type in a new paragraph (for simplicity, just hold down the m key) but do not press <Enter>\nyet\n3. Click on the HOME tab on the Ribbon then on the [Increase Indent] button\n- your text will\nmove in one tab stop (the left indent markers on the Ruler alter to reflect the new settings)\n4. Click on [Increase Indent] again and your text will move in by another tab stop\n5. To move the left margin back to a 1.27cm indent, click once on the [Decrease Indent] button\n(to the left of the [Increase Indent] button)\nNote that only the left indent changes. To move the right indent you have to drag the small triangle\non the right hand side of the ruler. Take care not to click on the Ruler or you will set a tab (as you\u2019ll\nsee later).\n6. Drag the right indent marker back to the 15cm mark\nTip: You may have noticed that the marker jumps along the ruler rather than moves smoothly. If\nyou need to set the indent precisely using this method, hold down <Alt> as you move the marker the actual size of the margin is displayed. You can, of course, also set the indents in the Paragraph\ndialog box, as you saw earlier.\n7. Return the right indent to its original position (it\u2019s easiest to use the [Undo] button as, believe it\nor not, you can\u2019t drag the marker to the exact place at 15.92cm unless you hold down the\n<Alt> key)\n8. Next, try changing the Hanging Indent by positioning the mouse cursor over the lower triangle\non the left and dragging it to the 2cm mark \u2013 references often appear like this in journals\n9. Repeat step 8 but this time drag the indent to the left margin (at 0.0cm) \u2013 you now have the\nfirst line still indented but the rest of your paragraph set to normal typing\n10. Finally, reset your paragraph to its default settings \u2013 simply click on the [Normal] style button\nNote: You shouldn\u2019t use the indent markers to change the page margins \u2013 set these in Page Layout.\nTip: It can sometimes be useful to move the right indent a fraction into the margin if your text\ndoesn\u2019t fit nicely on the page. Just a slight movement may result in a paragraph taking up one less\nline. If your text is justified (straight at the left and right) then you would need to do this for all the\nparagraphs on that page.\n\nUsing the Tab Key\nTabs are special characters used for lining up text. They should always be used rather than spaces\nwhen this is required - as, for example, in a table or vertical list. Spaces may appear to line things\nup, however, when the document is printed the carefully-spaced text rarely lines up properly.\nExplore how the <Tab> key (on the left immediately above <Caps Lock>) works:\n1. Press <Enter> for a new paragraph at the end of your text\n6\n\n\f2. Press <Tab> a few times (the cursor moves across the screen in jumps of 1.27cm or half an\ninch) then use <Backspace> to remove them and return the typing position to the left\n3. Type Name: then press <Tab> twice and type in your_own_name (press <Enter>)\n4. Type Address: press <Tab> once then type in the first line of your_address (press <Shift\nEnter>)\n5. Continue with your address, pressing <Tab> twice to line up each line of text and <Shift\nEnter>at the end of each line (press <Enter> at the end of the last line)\nNote: <Shift Enter> gives you a new line but not a new paragraph. As the default paragraph (normal)\nstyle has extra space between the paragraphs (to save pressing <Enter> twice) the lines would be\nvery widely spaced if they were all paragraphs. You should also use <Shift Enter> when you want\ntwo or more paragraphs to appear under the same number or bullet point when typing a list.\n\nSetting Tabs\nYou can set up your own tabs at different positions and you can also create tabs which line up text\non the right, centrally or on a particular character (eg a decimal point). To set a tab position, simply\nclick once on the Ruler. The default tab is a Left Tab but this next exercise also shows you how to set\ndifferent types:\n1. On a new line, press the <Tab> key once and type in a single short word (don\u2019t press <Enter>\nyet)\n2. Next, click on the Ruler at the 3cm mark \u2013 an L-symbol appears on the Ruler denoting a left tab\nand your text jumps across to start at this position\n3. Point to the tab symbol and drag it along the Ruler to a different position\n4. Release the mouse button and the text moves along to its new position\n5. Next, drag the tab down off the Ruler \u2013 the text returns to the default first tab (at 1.27cm)\nNow try setting several tabs, of different types:\n6. Repeat step 2 to set a Left Tab at 3cm\n7. Next, click once on the [Tab Select] button\nCenter Tab\n\non the far left of the Ruler \u2013 you now have a\n\n8. Click once on the Ruler at the 8cm mark \u2013 a different symbol appears, indicating the centre tab\n9. Press the <Tab> key once and type in a single short word \u2013 it appears centred on 8cm\n10. Repeat steps 7 to 9 to create a Right Tab at the 12cm mark and type a number\n11. Finally, repeat step 10 for a Decimal Tab at the 15cm mark \u2013 include a decimal point in the\nnumber\n12. Test out your tabs - press <Shift Enter> and type in another line of text/numbers\n13. Reset the default tab type to Left Tab by clicking four more times on the [Tab Select] button\nNote: You can also set up tabs without using the Ruler by opening the Paragraph dialog box (through\nthe group arrow\nnext to Paragraph on the HOME ribbon) and clicking on the [Tabs\u2026] button at the\nbottom left. This also allows you to set tab leaders, a series of dots or dashes linking text to page\nnumbers (as in a Table of Contents, for example). This happens automatically if you have been using\nHeading styles throughout your work, as you\u2019ll see next.\n1. Press <Enter> for a new line then reset the style to [Normal] to remove your tab settings\n2. Click on the REFERENCES tab on the Ruler, then on the [Table of Contents] button on the far left\n3. From the list that appears, choose the first option of Automatic Table 1 \u2013 a Table of Contents\nappears, with tab leaders between the text on the left and page numbers on the right\n4. Click on [Undo] to remove the Table of Contents as it isn\u2019t needed here\n7\n\n\f5. End by hiding the Ruler (unless you want to keep it displayed) \u2013 click on the [Ruler] button on\nthe VIEW tab\nAn essay (which this guide is aimed at) doesn\u2019t usually have a Table of Contents but a thesis or\ndissertation does. See the Microsoft Word: Starting a Thesis notes for further information about this,\nincluding how to automatically number your headings (1.1, 1.2, 1.2.1 etc.).\n\nTables\nAn alternative (and simpler) way to line up text is to use a table. You can justify the text in each\ncolumn (or even each cell) using the standard justification buttons ([Left], [Center] and [Right]) or the\nmore complex alignment settings you will be looking at in a minute. Note, however, that you can\u2019t\nline up numbers on a decimal point without using the special Decimal Tab.\nTip: You can set up tabs within cells in a table using the Ruler. To jump between these tabs, you can\u2019t\nsimply press the <Tab> key, instead you use what is termed a hard tab by pressing <Ctrl Tab>.\n1. Move to the INSERT tab on the Ribbon then click on the [Table] button in the Tables group\n\n2. A drop-down grid appears: drag through this to set up the size of the required table (here,\nselect three columns in the top row \u2013 if you make a mistake, click on the [Undo] button)\nTwo extra tabs appear on the Ribbon \u2013 TABLE TOOLS DESIGN and LAYOUT.\n3. In the first cell in the table, type Name then press <Tab> to move to the second column\n4. Type Address then press <Tab> to move to the third column\n5. Type Notes - press <Tab> again and you will find a second row automatically appears\n6. Fill in your own personal details again in this row, noting the instructions below\nWhen typing the address, press <Enter> at the end of each line - the cell automatically expands\ndownwards. At the end of the address press <Tab> to avoid having a blank line.\n7. In the column headed Notes, type in a few lines of rubbish text\nYou will find that the words wrap from one line to the next automatically - again, the cell expands\ndownwards if necessary as you type. If you want to include further rows in your table press <Tab>\nwhen you reach the last cell.\nBy default, the columns in a table are all made the same width. To adjust this:\n8. Move the mouse cursor over the column border between columns 1 and 2 (it will change to a\ndouble-headed arrow)\n9. Hold the mouse button down and drag the border to the left or right then release the mouse\nbutton\n8\n\n\fTo resize the columns to exactly fit the data:\n10. Double click on the column borders (do this on both the internal vertical borders)\n11. To widen the last column to fill the page, double click on the right-hand border\n12. Finally, to improve the look of the table, first select the top row (position the mouse cursor to\nthe left of the top row and click once)\n13. Press <Ctrl 0> (don\u2019t use the zero on the numeric keypad) to add some space above the text\n14. Next, press <Ctrl b> then <Ctrl e> to both embolden and centre the top row headings (or right\nclick then click on the [Bold] and [Center] buttons in the Format Text box which appears)\n\nInserting/Deleting Rows and Columns\nIf you used a right click when you carried out the last instruction, you may or may not have noticed\nthat you can also use this method to insert or delete a row or column in a table. There are also\nbuttons for these commands on the TABLE TOOLS DESIGN tab on the Ribbon (but it\u2019s easier to right\nclick).\n1. Right click in the top row of the table and choose Insert then Insert Rows Below \u2013 a new row\nappears\n2. Right click on the cell in the second column of the new row and choose Insert then Insert\nColumns to the Left \u2013 three columns are added because you had three cells selected (you need to\nwatch out for this)\n3. Press <Ctrl z> for [Undo] to remove the unwanted columns then repeat step 2 in the second\ncolumn of the top (or third) row \u2013 a single column appears between Name and Address\n4. Right click on any cell in the new selected column and this time choose Delete Columns\n5. Finally, right click on any of the empty cells in row 2 and choose Delete Cells... \u2013 a dialog box\nappears:\n\n6. Press <Enter> for [OK] \u2013 just that cell disappears, not the entire row\n7. Repeat step 5 but in the Delete Cells dialog box, choose Delete entire row before pressing\n<Enter>\n8. Adjust the column widths, if necessary, so that the table again stretches across the page\n\nTable Properties\nThere are some important table properties of which you should be aware. These allow you, for\nexample, to set a heading row for a table (which will be repeated if the table splits over two pages);\nprevent a row from splitting across a page or set a row to a fixed height.\n\n9\n\n\f1. Right click on any cell in the top row of the table and choose Table Properties\u2026 \u2013 a dialog box\nappears:\n\nThe Table Properties dialog box has five tabs (Table, Row, Column, Cell, Alt Text), each with different\nsettings. The settings on the Table tab (currently shown) will be dealt with later.\n2. Click on the Row tab\n3. Turn on Specify height: and set this to 2cm\nNote the other options here. Ideally, cells in a table shouldn\u2019t split across pages and the top row\nshould be a header row:\n4. Turn ON the Repeat as header row at the top of each page option\n5. Turn OFF the Allow row to break across pages option then click on the [Next Row] button\n6. Repeat step 5 for this and any other rows in the table\n7. Click on the Column and Cell tabs to see the settings there (but don\u2019t change anything)\n8. Press <Enter> for [OK] to enforce the changes you have made to the properties\n9. Move the typing position before Name in the first cell and press <Enter> a few times \u2013 you\u2019ll\nfind it expands further as you add the blank lines \u2013 then use <Ctrl z> to remove them\nTip: To prevent a cell expanding like this, when setting the row height turn on the Row height is:\nExactly option (this is currently set to At least). This should always be used for forms which are to be\nprinted.\n\nThe Layout and Design Tabs\nMany of the commands covered in the previous three sections can also be found on the TABLE TOOLS\nLAYOUT tab:\n1. Move to the LAYOUT tab on the Ribbon\nIn the Table group on the left, the [Select] button can be used to select part or the whole of the table\n\u2013 the whole table can also be selected by clicking on the boxed four-headed arrow on the left above\nthe table.\n2. Click on [Select] then choose Select Row to select the top row (or click to the left of the row if\nyou prefer using the mouse; click immediately above a column to select a column)\n3. The Rows & Columns group has buttons for inserting or deleting cells/rows/columns\n10\n\n\f4. In the Merge group, you can merge two or more cells together and can split cells or the whole\ntable\n5. The Cell Size group lets you set the column width and row height (or distribute them evenly)\n6. In the Alignment group, you can set the cell justification, both horizontally and vertically \u2013 try\nout the various buttons (end with the central button \u2013 [Align Center])\n7. The Data group includes [Repeat Header Rows] and [Sort]\nThe TABLE TOOLS DESIGN tab is dominated by Table Styles which work in a similar way to heading\nstyles etc. These allow you to completely change the look of a table at the click of a button. Again,\nyou can define your own styles if you so wish. Of more interest to the average user are the borders\nand shading settings:\n1. Click on the DESIGN tab on the Ribbon\n2. The Table Style Options group on the left is used to define the various parts of the table to be\nused with styles (i.e. the [Header Row] button is nothing to do with [Repeat Header Rows] )\n3. In the Table Styles group, move the mouse over some of the styles provided to see their effect\n(don\u2019t click on any of them)\n4. Using the [Shading] button (click on the arrow underneath), colour the selected top row a light\ngrey\n5. In the Borders group, use the arrow underneath [Borders] to remove/add borders to selected\ncells\nThe Borders group lets you set up the line style, width and colour. You can then use the mouse to\nredraw lines or you can use the [Borders] button to apply the change to the cell (or pre-selected\nrange)\n6. Click on the [Line Style] button (to the left of [Borders]) and choose a double line \u2013 the [Border\nPainter] button is turned on and the cursor changes to a paintbrush\n7.\n\nPoint the brush cursor to a line and click the mouse button \u2013 it changes to a double line\n\n8. Click on the LAYOUT tab at the top, and try out the [Eraser] button in the Draw group on the\nleft of the ribbon \u2013 click with the rubber cursor to remove a border\n9. The Eraser merges cells if the line is internal \u2013 click on [Undo] to reverse this then turn off\n[Eraser]\nNote that you can add a border to any piece of text (from a word to a whole page) - for example, a\nline above and below a heading. The buttons for these borders\nare in the Paragraph group on\nthe HOME tab and the Page Background group on the DESIGN tab. Borders are another feature which\ncan be set in a style.\nTip: If you want to have some text next to a diagram, simply create a table with one row and two\ncolumns. Place the diagram in one cell and the text in the other then remove the borders. Use the\n[View Gridlines] button on the far left of the LAYOUT tab if you want to see where the table is \u2013 these\ndo not print.\nTo learn more about tables, borders and shading, see the Microsoft Word: Tables advanced notes.\n\nCaptions\nIn the same way that Heading styles should be used for your main headings, Captions should be used\nfor your figures and tables. These can then automatically generate a Table of Figures and a Table of\nTables and allow you to cross-reference them in your text.\n1. Click anywhere inside the table\n\n11\n\n\f2. Move to the REFERENCES tab and choose [Insert Caption] in the Captions group\n\n3. The default Position: is Above selected item but this can be changed \u2013 press <Enter> for [OK]\n4. Complete your caption by typing in some text\nNote: You can redefine the Caption style if you don\u2019t like the way it looks, as you did earlier with\nHeadings.\nTo cross-reference your table:\n5. Move to a new line at the end of your work (press <Ctrl End> then <Enter>) then click on\n[Cross-reference] in the Captions group\n6. Change Reference type: to Table (scroll down) and Insert reference to: to Only label and number\n7. Press <Enter> for [Insert] then <Esc> to [Close] the Caption dialog box\n8. Type in some text about the table to complete the sentence\nYou can use captions and cross-referencing for figures, equations, footnotes and your own captions\n(eg photographs, maps) in exactly the same way. End by generating a Table of Tables:\n9. Press <Enter> for a new paragraph then click on [Insert Table of Figures] in the Captions group\n10. Check the Caption label: is set correctly to Table then press <Enter> for [OK]\n11. Press <Ctrl z> for [Undo] to remove the Table of Tables as it isn\u2019t needed here\nTo learn more about captions, see the Microsoft Word: Starting a Thesis notes.\n\nInserting Things\nFootnotes (and Endnotes)\nTo insert a footnote:\n1. Move the typing position to where the footnote indicator should appear\n2. On the REFERENCES tab, click on the [Insert Footnote] button in the Footnotes group\n3. Type in your footnote (anything will do here) then click back on the main text (or press <up\narrow>)\nNote that there is also an [Insert Endnote] button. Endnotes appear below the end of your text;\nfootnotes at the bottom of each page. Try inserting an endnote, if you like, and then use [Undo] to\nremove it.\nTo change a note:\n4. Click on the text of the note at the bottom to move the typing position and edit as usual, then\nclick back on the main text\n12\n\n\fTo delete a note:\n5. Drag through the note indicator in the main text to select it then press <Delete>\n\nSpecial Characters\nAs well as the characters found on the keyboard, you might want to include special mathematical\nsymbols, fractions and accented characters. To insert a special character:\n1. Move to the INSERT tab and click on [Symbol] (far right) then More Symbols\u2026 - a dialog box\nappears:\n\n2. If necessary, click on the list arrow attached to the Font: box and choose (normal text) at the top\nof the Font: list\n3. Use the scroll bar on the right to move up and down the symbols \u2013 the Subset: box helps you\nmove directly to sets of symbols (e.g. Greek Extended or Mathematical Operators)\n4. Double click on a character to insert it - note that it's also added to the Recently used symbols:\nFor characters in a different font:\n5. Click on the list arrow attached to the Font: box and choose Wingdings \u2013 near the bottom of the\nlist\nYou can now select all sorts of characters from smiley faces to arrows and everyday objects like\ntelephones!\n6. Add a few more characters then choose (normal text) at the top of the Font: list to return to\nnormal\n7. Next, click on the Special Characters tab for yet more symbols (eg a non-breaking space, used\nwhere two words must not be separated)\n8. Press <Esc> or click on [Close] to close the Symbol window\nYou may have noticed that for many characters a Shortcut key has been set up. Some of these involve\nusing the <Alt> key plus the numeric key pad, others the <Ctrl> key plus normal keys. A degree\nsign, for example, can either be obtained (make sure the numeric key pad has been activated by\n<Num Lock>) by holding down <Alt> and typing 0176 or <Ctrl @> (i.e. <Ctrl Shift \u2018>) followed by\npressing the <spacebar> key (note that this may not work).\nThat particular key combination isn\u2019t very intuitive and Word allows you to set up your own\nshortcut keys. The key combinations for foreign accents are easier to remember, however. Essentially,\nyou type the accent using the <Ctrl> key, and then follow that with the letter you require:\n9. Hold down <Ctrl> and type a comma, then release <Ctrl> and type c\n\n13\n\n\fYou should have typed \u00e7. Some other accents you might want include <Ctrl '> for an acute accent,\n<Ctrl `> for a grave, <Ctrl ^> (i.e. <Ctrl Shift 6>) for a circumflex, and <Ctrl Shift ;> for an umlaut.\nJust follow these with the appropriate vowel. Other foreign-language characters include <Ctrl />\nfollowed by <o> for \u00f8, <Ctrl @> (i.e. <Ctrl Shift \u2018>) followed by <a> for \u00e5 and <Ctrl ~> (i.e. <Ctrl Shift\n#>) followed by <n> for \u00f1.\nTo learn more, see the Microsoft Word: Symbols, Foreign Characters and Keyboards advanced notes.\n\nPage Breaks\nSometimes you may wish to start a new page, for example for a new section or to put a table or\ndiagram on a separate page. The temptation is to add blank lines by pressing <Enter> but, as you\nchange your text, these breaks move up and down the paper. Instead, you should fix the position by\ninserting a hard page break. These can be added from the [Page Break] button at the start of the\nINSERT ribbon or, more simply:\n1. Click where you would like the new page to appear\n2. Hold down <Ctrl> and press <Enter> - a new page will appear\n3. If you want a blank (numbered) page in a document, press <Ctrl Enter> a second time (or click\non the [Blank Page] button above [Page Break] on the INSERT ribbon)\nTo remove a break, move to the top of the following page and press the <Backspace> key twice (or\nmove to the foot of the previous page and press <Delete> once).\n\nPage Numbers\nTo add page numbers to your document:\n1. On the INSERT tab click on [Page Number] in the Header & Footer group\n2. Choose Top of Page or Bottom of Page then the layout you prefer (usually the first three\nlayouts put the page number to the left, centre or right respectively)\nIt\u2019s generally a good idea to keep the layout simple but scroll down to see more complex layouts.\n3. Select the layout you prefer \u2013 the HEADER & FOOTER TOOLS DESIGN tab appears\n4. Click on the [Page Number] button in the new Header & Footer group on the left\n5. Choose Format Page Numbers\u2026 - the Page Number Format dialog box appears:\n\n6. Here, you can set the Number format: (e.g. i or - 1 -) and can Start at: a number other than 1\n7. Make any required changes then press <Enter> or click on [OK]\n\n14\n\n\fTip: If you want to have different page numbering in different parts of your document (eg Roman\nnumerals for the introductory pages of a thesis) then you need to divide your document into\nsections. A section break can be added using the [Breaks] button on the PAGE LAYOUT tab. Once you\nhave the sections, each can have its own settings \u2013 page numbering, header, footer (see below) etc.\n\nHeaders and Footers\nWhile the Header & Footer Tools Design tab is open, have a look at the other settings:\n1. In the Header & Footer group, you can select from built-in [Header] or [Footer] layouts\n2. In the Insert group, you can insert a date & time field (which can be fixed or which updates\nautomatically)\n3. In the Navigation group you can move between the header and footer (the <up/down arrow>\nkeys also work)\n4. In the Options group you can set a [Different First Page] \u2013 e.g. if you don\u2019t want this page\nnumbered\n5. Click on the [Close Header and Footer] button on the far right to move back to your text\nTip: You can also double click away from the header/footer (double clicking on a header/footer reactivates\nit) to move back to your text.\n\nReferences and a Bibliography\nWhen writing an essay or dissertation, you may want to include a bibliography. In Word 2013 you\ncan have your own library of references, from which you can add selected references to your\ndocument.\n1. Position yourself in the text and then move to the REFERENCES tab on the Ribbon\n2. Click on [Insert Citation] in the Citations & Bibliography group and choose Add New Source\u2026\n\n3. In the Create Source dialog box, type in a reference (again, anything will do but fill out all the\nfields)\n4. Press <Enter> for [OK] and your reference (author, year) appears in your text\n5. Repeat steps 2 to 4 for a second reference\n6. Type in some more text then insert one of the references again \u2013 click on [Insert Citation] and\nchoose one of the references from the list at the top\n7. Now click on the [Bibliography] button in the same group and choose Insert Bibliography or a\nBuilt-In one\u2013 your references appear in full at the end of your document\n8. To change the referencing style (eg to Harvard), choose the required style from the [Style:]\nbutton\n9. Use <Ctrl z> to [Undo] any style changes and remove your bibliography\n15\n\n\fThe [Manage Sources] button lets you pick up references from your library in other documents. For\nfurther information see the Microsoft Word: References and Bibliography advanced notes.\n\nGraphics, Pictures and Shapes\nYou might want to insert a picture into your text. Microsoft has its own selection of pictures that\nyou can use or you can insert your own objects (eg Excel charts, scanned photographs or pictures\nyou have drawn saved as JPEG, GIF or PNG files). For example, to insert a picture from the Online\nPictures Clip Art Gallery:\n1. Position the insertion point where you want to insert the picture\n2. Move to the INSERT tab and click on [Online Pictures] in the Illustrations group (use [Pictures]\nfor your own picture, [SmartArt] for a more advanced graphic like an organisation chart,\n[Chart] for a new chart, and [Object] in the Text group for an Excel chart)\nAn Insert Pictures window appears. Here you can search for a specific picture clip (on your PC or the\nWWW) from Office.com Clip Art (or use the Bing Image search engine).\n3. Click in the search box next to Office.com Clip Art, type something (e.g. sport) and then press\n<Enter> for [Go]\n4. Click on a picture and then [Insert]\nThe picture should already be selected - handles (small squares) show at the corners and edges of the\npicture. A PICTURE TOOLS FORMAT ribbon appears at the top.\nA Layout Options icon\nwill show to the right of the picture. This can be used to change the way\nthat text wraps around the picture. The default Text Wrapping setting is for the picture to be In Line\nwith Text. This means that it can be moved around as if it were a word. There are several other\nsettings but these should be avoided unless you know what you are doing. To find out more\ninformation see the Microsoft Word: Graphics advanced notes.\n5. Drag the handles to change the image's size/shape or use the buttons provided in the Size group\non the far right of the PICTURE TOOLS FORMAT tab\nTip: Resizing from a corner circle handle will ensure that the proportions of the image stay the same\n\u2013 if you use a handle at the side it will distort your image.\n6. Use the circular arrow above the central handle on the top border to rotate the shape\n7. Click on the [Crop] button in the Size group on the right and drag one of the black lines (in\nplace of the resizing handles) inwards to hide part of the picture. Click again on the [Crop]\nbutton to accept this change\n8. Press the key combination of <Ctrl e> to centre your picture horizontally on the page\nFinally, add a caption:\n9. Click on the picture (to activate it) then move to the REFERENCES tab and click on [Insert\nCaption] in the Captions group (about halfway along the ribbon)\n10. Check that the Label: is set to Figure and select the required Position: (usually below for a figure)\nthen click on [OK]\n11. Complete the caption then press <Enter> for a new paragraph\nTo insert a shape:\n1. Move back to the INSERT tab on the Ribbon and click on the [Shapes] button\n2. Select a shape then position the mouse cursor (a cross or plus sign) where you want the shape\nto appear, hold down the mouse button and drag out the shape\n3. Release the mouse button to fix the shape\u2019s size \u2013 the DRAWING TOOLS FORMAT tab appears\n16\n\n\fHandles are provided, as with a picture. Some shapes (eg a smiley face) also have yellow spots, which\nallow you to modify the shape. See the document Microsoft Office: The Drawing Tools for further\ninformation.\n4. Click away from the shape to close the Drawing Tools Format tab\nAnother feature in Word allows you to insert a screenshot from a different window/application:\n1. Place the current typing position where you want the screenshot to appear\n2. On the INSERT tab, click on the [Screenshot] button (last in the Illustrations group)\n3. If you want a whole window then choose it from those available\n4. If not, choose Screen Clipping. Using the mouse cursor (shows as a cross or plus sign), drag\nover the area of the window required then release the mouse button \u2013 the area selected will\nbe inserted into your text as a picture\n\nEquations\nTo insert an equation:\n1. Move to a new line at the end of your document (press <Ctrl End> and <Enter> if necessary)\n2. On the INSERT tab, click on the [Equation] list arrow in the Symbols group on the far right\n3. Select one of the Built-in equations (e.g. Area of Circle) \u2013 the EQUATION TOOLS DESIGN tab shows\n4. Move along the equation using the <arrow keys> adding or replacing existing text/values as\nyou go\n5. Click away from the equation once you have finished making changes\nNote: Equations can be numbered in the same way as tables/figures (using a Caption) and crossreferenced. See the Microsoft Word: Equations advanced notes for further details.\n\nAdding Comments and Tracking Changes\nThe facility to show what changes/corrections have been made to a document since it was last saved\nis a useful, if sometimes annoying, one. You can also add comments in balloons:\n1. Move to the REVIEW tab on the Ribbon and click on the icon above [Track Changes] in the\nTracking group to turn tracking on (the status bar at the bottom of the window may now show\nthat Track Changes are turned on)\n2. Now type in some new text \u2013 a red vertical line will appear in the left margin marking this line\nas new\n3. Select some text from earlier in your document and <Delete> it \u2013 the text is deleted and\nanother red vertical line appears on the left\n4. Select a word and make it bold (press <Crtl b> or click on [Bold]) \u2013 the text turns bold and\nanother red vertical line appears\n5. Click on the box with a down arrow displaying Simple Markup and change it to All Markup \u2013 the\nred lines go grey, the deleted text appears in red with a line through it and the bold\nformatting is highlighted by a balloon on the right\n6. Click the [Show Markup] button in the Tracking group (just underneath the All Markup box)\nchoose Balloons then select Show all Revisions Inline\nNote that any formatting changes (here, the bold command at step 5) are not shown in balloons.\nTo get the balloons back:\n7. Repeat step 6 but select Show Revisions in Balloons \u2013 all changes, apart from new added text,\nwill be highlighted in balloons on the right of your document\n17\n\n\f8. Select some different text and click on the [New Comment] button in the Comments group\n9. A comment balloon appears (note that your username or name will probably show to indicate\nwho\u2019s writing the comment) \u2013 type in some text as a comment\nTo delete a comment:\n10. Click on the comment then use the [Delete] button in the Comments group\nTo delete all comments:\n11. Click on any comment then on the arrow attached to the [Delete] button and choose Delete\nAll Comments in Document\nTo accept or reject changes to your document:\n12. Click on the change then use the [Accept] or [Reject] button in the Changes group\nTo accept all the changes and turn off tracking:\n13. Click on the list arrow below [Accept] and choose Accept All Changes and Stop Tracking\n14. [Save] the final version of your document \u2013 press <Ctrl s>\nSee the Microsoft Word: Tracking Changes advanced notes for further details.\n\nPrinting and Page Setup\nInstructions on how to print your document were covered in the Microsoft Word: An Essential Guide\ncourse notes; here you will look at how you can change the layout on the printed page.\n1. Move to the PAGE LAYOUT tab and look at the Page Setup group\n2. The [Margins] button lets you set up the margins (the white space surrounding your text)\n3. The [Orientation] button lets you choose Landscape to turn the paper sideways\n4. The paper [Size] should normally be set to A4\n5. The [Hyphenation] button lets you turn on automatic hyphenation (so that long words at the\nend of a line are split onto two lines)\nTip: To see all the Page Setup settings in a single dialog box, click on the Page Setup group arrow.\n\nFinishing Off\nYou have now completed the Intermediate training, but there\u2019s a lot more to learn about Microsoft\nWord. Various guides to Microsoft Word: Advanced Topics are available on the WWW and there are\nspecial notes to help you when using Microsoft Word for a Thesis (starting and finishing). Don't\nforget that Word has a comprehensive on-line help facility via the [Help] button (\nin the top right\ncorner) or press the <F1> function key, usually on the top row of your keyboard.\nTo leave Microsoft Word:\n1. Press <Alt F4> or click on the cross in the top right-hand corner of the Word window\n2.

2013\n\nWORKING WITH FIGURES\n\nLive Layout: As you make changes to a picture within a document, Word will show the position\nof the picture in real time, as opposed to guessing what the image will look like upon resizing or\nrotating.\nAlignment Guides: Word will now help you position objects exactly where you need them to be\nby incorporating guides when moving objects to specific places within a document.\nLayout Options: A button will appear at the top right of an object when it is selected. This\nbutton will allow you to adjust text wrapping more easily.\nSHARE AND COLLABORATE\n\nSimplified Sharing: The share options allow you to invite people to work on a document with\nyou. More specifically, choose who you want to share with, and how you want to share (edit\nand read, or just read?).\nSimple Markup: Users can now see \u201cwho changed what and when\u201d while tracking changes. This\nmakes revision details easier to sift through.\nComments and Tracking: You can now reply to comments and have a discussion rather than\nhaving to delete them. If you would like all changes to be tracked, you can enable a password\nsetting so that editors won\u2019t accidentally turn off the tracking option.\nPDF Reflow: You can now transform PDF files back into fully editable Word formats.\nRead Mode: Reading Word documents is now more user-friendly, with the addition of column\nlayouts, object zoom options, as well as dictionary definitions and translations. The navigation\npane has also been tweaked to look more modernized. Also, check out the new web video\nintegration, where you can embed YouTube content directly into your documents.\n\n3\n\n\fWord 2013 Advanced\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe Advanced Word course enables proficient users of Microsoft Word to gain a more detailed\nunderstanding of Word\u2019s capabilities, and learn how to utilize these tools effectively for the\ncreation of unique, professional projects. In this advanced course we will also navigate from\none tab to another, exploring the less prominent and more advanced features of Word 2013.\nThis documentation will cover some of the following skills:\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\nHyperlinks\nLanguage Tools\nCross-Referencing\nLine Numbers\nWatermarks\nFootnotes/Endnotes\nCitations/Bibliographies\nCaptions\nIndexing\nAdding Comments\nTrack Changes\nAccepting/Rejecting Changes\nComparing Documents\n\n4\n\n\fWord 2013 Advanced\nTHE INSERT TAB\n\nThe Insert Tab allows you to insert items and illustrations into your document that\ngo beyond plain text. In Word Essentials we focused primarily on the Illustrations\nGroup within this tab. In Advanced we will go more in-depth with screenshots,\nhyperlinks, text boxes, quick parts, and drop caps.\nSCREENSHOT\n\nScreenshots was introduced in Office 2010 and has made a reappearance in Office 2013.\nScreenshot allows users to capture the screen as it currently looks, making it a portable image\nthat one can place within the document.\n1: Click the Screenshots dropdown menu, located at the far right of the Illustrations Group.\n2: There are a few options available:\na. you can capture the entire screen as is, or\nb. you can capture your screen without the Word window that you are using as part of the\nimage.\nc. If you only want to capture a small portion of the screen, such as one icon on your\ndesktop, then you can utilize the \u201cScreen Clipping\u201d tool. Select one of these options by\nclicking once.\n\n3: Once you have selected a screenshot option, the portable image of your screen will be\nautomatically inserted into your document. Once the Screen Shots option is chosen, the entire\ncomputer screen will become faded (don\u2019t be alarmed, this doesn\u2019t mean the computer is\nfreezing) and your mouse pointer will turn into a crosshair. You can drag this crosshair to select\n5\n\n\fWord 2013 Advanced\nthe portion of your screen that you wish to capture. This clip will be inserted as an image into\nyour document.\nINSERTING HYPERLINKS\n\nThis function allows you to insert a hyperlink into your document. This is useful\nbecause rather than having to copy and paste a website address from the document\ninto your web browser, you and whoever else accesses your document will be able\nto click the link in the document and immediately open the website.\n1: Select the \u201cHyperlinks\u201d button in the Links group.\n2: A dialogue box will appear with several options for how to insert your hyperlink:\na.\nb.\nc.\nd.\n\nselect something from a folder, or\nselect a website address from a list of your recently browsed websites, or\nselect a recent file.\nIf you want to simply manually type in the website address that you would like to link to,\nthen you may do so by typing it next to \u201cAddress:\u201d in the dialogue box.\n\n4: If you would like the link to appear as something other than the website address, then\nsimply type a title or display text next to \u201cText to display:\u201d at the top of the dialogue box. For\nexample, if the website address that you selected to insert is \u201chttp://www.facebook.com\u201d, but\nyou only want the link to appear as \u201cFacebook\u201d then you would just type \u201cFacebook\u201d into the\n\u201cText to display:\u201d space before clicking OK.\n\n6\n\n\fWord 2013 Advanced\nTEXT BOXES\n\nA text box is a moveable field where you can enter text, and apply formatting to that\ntext that does not apply to or affect the rest of your document.\n\n1: Place your cursor wherever you wish to insert the text box into your document. Click the\n\u201cText Box\u201d dropdown menu in the Text group within the Insert Tab.\n2: Click a pre-determined text box, or select \u201cdraw text box.\u201d\n\n7\n\n\fWord 2013 Advanced\n\n\u201cShow me a hero and I can write you a\ntragedy.\u201d \u2013F. Scott Fitzgerald\n\nExample of a textbox when\nyou write in it.\n\n3: Once you have inserted your text box, you can resize it, move it around within your\ndocument, and format the interior text according to your preferences.\nFANCY TEXTBOXES AND PICTURES WITH TEXT\n\nTo position the textbox within the picture is really the same thing, except you may find that the\nsimple textbox might just be that\u2026too simple for the picture you want to use (especially if\nyou\u2019re handing it in and a publisher, employer, whoever wants a clean looking, fancy\npresentation).\n1: select the picture you want to use.\n\n8\n\n\fWord 2013 Advanced\n\n2. Chose \u201ctext box,\u201d then choose a text box from the drop down menu.\n3. To insert the textbox, you would repeat the same process that you used for the simple\ntextbox. However, you\u2019d choose a fancier one.\n\n9\n\n\fWord 2013 Advanced\nThen insert the austere textbox on or below the photo (depending which looks better) as seen\nbelow (both options):\n\nFORMATTING TEXTBOXES\n\n1. With your text box selected, click the drawing tools.\n2. Adjust shape fill, outline, and add effects in the shape styles group.\nClick here\n\n3. Scroll down the \u201cno fill\u201d option,\n\n10\n\n\fWord 2013 Advanced\nDROP CAPS\n\nDrop Caps are an author\u2019s favorite tool and for good reason too. The general purpose of inserting\na drop cap is to aesthetically enhance your document. For example:\n\u201cA young man, named Giovanni Guasconti, came, very long ago, from the more\nsouthern region of Italy, to pursue his studies at the University of Padua. Giovanni,\nwho had but a scanty supply of gold ducats in his pocket, took lodgings in a high\nand gloomy chamber of an old edifice, which looked not unworthy to have been the\npalace of a Paduan noble, and which, in fact, exhibited over its entrance the\narmorial bearings of a family long since extinct.\u201d (Rappacini\u2019s Daughter by\nNathaniel Hawthorne)\nversus:\n\nA\n\nyoung man, named Giovanni Guasconti, came, very long ago, from the\nmore southern region of Italy, to pursue his studies at the University of\nPadua. Giovanni, who had but a scanty supply of gold ducats in his\npocket, took lodgings in a high and gloomy chamber of an old edifice,\nwhich looked not unworthy to have been the palace of a Paduan noble, and which, in\nfact, exhibited over its entrance the armorial bearings of a family long since extinct.\nThere will rarely be a time when a Drop Cap is necessary in a document. However, it looks\ngreat if it is appropriate to the document you are creating.\n1: Type at least the first paragraph of your document. Drop Caps can only be inserted once\nseveral lines have been written.\n2: Place your cursor at the beginning of the document (if that\u2019s where you want your drop cap\nto be inserted). Click the Drop Cap dropdown menu in your Insert Tab.\n\n11\n\n\fWord 2013 Advanced\n\n3: You can choose between two Drop Cap options: \u201cDropped\u201d or \u201cIn Margin\u201d\u2014the pictures\nnext to these options pretty accurately display what will happen if you choose either one. This\nwill impact only the paragraph that you have selected. Drop caps will not continue as new\nparagraphs are created.\n4: Once you select a Drop Cap option, it will be inserted into your document at the beginning of\nthe paragraph you have selected. If the Cap is too big or not big enough, you can manually\nresize it by clicking and dragging the corners of its box once it is selected.\n5: Change other options by selecting Drop Cap options\u2026 in the Drop Cap menu.\n\n12\n\n\fWord 2013 Advanced\nThe following dialogue box should appear:\n\nYou can adjust the style of Drop Cap, change the font, adjust the lines to drop, and adjust the\ndistance from text.\n\nTHE PAGE LAYOUT TAB\n\nThe Page Layout Tab allows you to make alterations to the actual page that you are\nworking with.\nCOLUMNS\n\n1. Click the Columns dropdown menu, located in the Page Setup group.\n\n13\n\n\fWord 2013 Advanced\n2. Select the column division of your choice. When you select a division, that number of\ncolumns will be applied to your entire document. Once these columns have been applied, you\ncan adjust the size of each column using the ruler.\n3. If you are not satisfied with the five options in this dropdown menu, then click More\nColumns\u2026 at the foot of the menu.\n\n4. This dialogue box allows you to customize the number of columns in your document. It\nalso allows you to choose whether to apply columns to your whole document, the rest\nof your document, or simply to the area of text that you have selected.\n\n14\n\n\fWord 2013 Advanced\nLINE NUMBERS\n\nLine Numbers are a way for the writer and reader to keep track of how many lines there are.\nThese typically can be seen with poems in an anthology.\n1: Located right next to the columns feature, you will see an option for page numbers. Click\nthat and you will be given a scroll down menu.\n\n2: You will be given a list of options of how you\u2019d like to position the numbers and the words.\n\nExample of top centered line\nnumbering, which the text body\nwill appear in the top of the\npage.\n\n15\n\n\fWord 2013 Advanced\n\nExample of centered line\nnumbering.\n\nExample of bottom line\nnumbering, the text will\nappear bottom of the page.\n\n16\n\n\fWord 2013 Advanced\n\nTHE DESIGN TAB\nWATERMARKS\n\nA watermark is a faded stamp that appears in the background of your document. This function\ncan be very useful if you wish to brand your document with a message that sets it apart from an\neveryday piece of paper. For example, messages like \u201cSAMPLE,\u201d \u201cDO NOT COPY,\u201d\n\u201cCONFIDENTIAL\u201d etc. can all be made immediately noticeable by putting them on the\ndocument as a watermark.\n1: Click on the Watermark dropdown menu in the Page Background group of the Design Tab.\n\nHere you will see a variety of options for ready-made watermarks that Microsoft Word has\nprovided for you.\n\n17\n\n\fWord 2013 Advanced\n2: Create a custom watermark by selecting \u201ccustom watermark\u2026\u201d in the watermark dropdown\nmenu.\n\nClicking this will open the custom watermark dialogue box.\n\n3. This dialogue box will allow you to enter specific, custom text as your watermark, or even to\ninsert an image as your watermark. For example, if you are writing a letter or flyer around a\ncertain holiday, you can insert a holiday appropriate image that will lay washed out in the\nbackground of your text. Example below:\n\n18\n\n\fWord 2013 Advanced\n\nKeep in mind that you MUST have whatever picture you\u2019re going to use already saved on your\nhard drive. You CANNOT use clipart. However, if you do want clipart, visit the Microsoft website\nand you can download the clipart to save on your hard drive.\n\n19\n\n\fWord 2013 Advanced\nPAGE BORDERS\n\nWord allows you to apply a border to your document, to create a professional or a decorative\nlook. To do so, click Page Borders in the Page Background group of the Design tab. When you\ndo this, the Borders and Shading dialogue box will appear. (Pictured below:)\n\nThis box allows you to play with various border options, and adjust them to your needs. There\nare simple line options, shadowing options, and options for more intricate border designs,\nwhich you can find in the Art dropdown menu.\nThe Preview area of this box allows you to see how your document will look with the borders in\nplace. If you only wish to apply a border to certain sides of the document, you can adjust this\nby clicking the four square buttons in the Preview area.\n\n20\n\n\fWord 2013 Advanced\nTHE REVIEW TAB\n\nThe Review Tab helps you to make corrections and notations on your\ndocument so that you can have a polished and well-edited finished product.\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nAs you review a document you may want to make a side note without editing the main text of\nwhat you have written. The Comments group within the Review tab allows you to do this.\nComments serve as sort of virtual sticky notes by letting you add or remove comments along\nthe side of your document.\nStep 1: To create a comment about a particular area in your document, click that part of the\npage so that your cursor is in the area you would like to comment on.\nStep 2: Click on the New Comment button in the Comments group within the Review Tab.\n\nStep 3: A sidebar to the left will appear which shows the latest revisions that you\u2019ve made to\nyour document. You can see all your comments by clicking \u201cShow Comments,\u201d which would\nappear as below.\n\n21\n\n\fWord 2013 Advanced\n\nThese comments become visible in your document when you click \u201cShow Markup\u201d in the\nTracking group of the Review tab. You can select this option by clicking the first small\ndropdown menu in the Tracking tab, and selecting \u201cAll Markup\u201d\n\nOnce you have selected this, an extension will appear on the right side of your document,\nwhich will show all of your comments and formatting changes.\n22\n\n\fWord 2013 Advanced\n\nType comment there.\n\nIf you want to jump from comment to comment without scrolling around to find them, you can\nclick the Previous and Next buttons within the comments group to navigate through the\ncomments that you have made throughout your document. You can also delete comments as\nyou go, if necessary.\n\nTRACK CHANGES\n\nTrack changes are important for when you have to send a document to someone to\ngive feedback. A feature that was new to Word 2010, Word 2013 also has the track\nchanges. This allows you to make the changes in one document while keeping the\noriginal document instead of having multiple documents.\nFor example, if you create a document and email it to your colleague for feedback, they can\nedit the document with Track Changes on. When they send the document back to you, you can\nsee what changes they have made, and then choose whether or not to accept these changes.\nTo turn Track Changes on, click Track Changes in the Tracking group under the Review tab.\nThen select Track Changes again in the dropdown menu that appears.\n\n23\n\n\fWord 2013 Advanced\n\nOnce you have the Track Changes turned on, you will be given a few different options of how\nyou want to make corrections, as followed:\n\nIf you go with All Markup, you will have a document that will look like this:\n\nHowever, if you go with Final, you won\u2019t get the purple underlined words as you would for\nFinal: Show Markup and Original: Show Markup. The original, is obviously your original piece.\n\n24\n\n\fWord 2013 Advanced\nDepending on what you\u2019re working on, Word gives two different options to how you can view\nthe document: horizontal or vertical.\nStep 1: Go to the Track Changes icon, then reviewing pane.\n\nStep 2: You will be brought to a drop down menu, as seen below:\n\nIf you would like to print a document with the tracked changes included, you can click List of\nMarkup under \u201cPrint\u201d in the File tab.\n\n25\n\n\fWord 2013 Advanced\nCOMPARING DOCUMENTS\n\nThe Compare feature in the Review tab allows you to compare your revised document with the\noriginal document, and also gives you the option of combining multiple revised documents into\none final project.\n1: Click the Compare button under the Review tab, and in the dropdown menu that appears,\nselect \u201cCompare\u201d\n\n2: In the dropdown menu beneath \u201cOriginal document,\u201d select the file of your original\ndocument before revision. In the dropdown menu beneath \u201cRevised document,\u201d select the file\nof your final document after revisions.\n3: Click \u201cOK.\u201d A new window will appear, which, on one pane, will show your original\ndocument, your revised document, and a third view that combines both documents to show\nwhat revisions have been made. (Pictured on the following page\u2026)\n\n26\n\n\fWord 2013 Advanced\n\nCOMPARING DOCUMENTS CONTINUED\u2026\n\nThis section of the Compare Window shows the changes and comments on the main\ndocument.\nThis section of the Compare Window shows the original document, before revisions\nwere made.\nThis section of the Compare Window shows the document after revisions.\nThis section of the window shows the compared document.\n\n27\n\n\fWord 2013 Advanced\nPROTECT/RESTRICT EDITING\n\nIf you don\u2019t want someone editing your piece for some reason or if there is a part\nthat you don\u2019t want edited in any circumstances, Word 2013 has a protect feature\nthat allows you to block authors (might not be available on all computers) and/or\nrestricting the editing.\nBLOCK AUTHORS\n\nIn the Block Authors function, you block other authors from making changes to the text.\nRESTRICT EDITING\n\nHere you can restrict how people edit or format parts of your document. You can also prevent\nformatting changes, force all changes to be tracked, or only enable comments.\nIf you would like to restrict the editing on your document, it can be done in a few easy steps.\n1: Click Restrict Editing. You will be brought to this side pane view:\nFormat restrictions are reserved for preventing the\nability to modify styles and applying direct\nformatting to the document.\n\nEditing restrictions are reserved for changes in the\ntrack changes, comments, filling in forms or no\nchanges at all. If you choose this feature, you will\nbe brought to groups that you want this to apply\nto.\nClick here to begin those specifications.\n\nKeep in mind; you might get this\ndialogue box.\n\n28\n\n\fWord 2013 Advanced\n\n2: Once you mark what you want done to your piece, you can click Yes\u2026 and when you send\nthis piece off, people won\u2019t be able to change it or will have to change to your specifications.\n\nTHE REFERENCES TAB\n\nThe References Tab allows you to insert footnotes, endnotes, and bibliographies.\nENDNOTES VERSUS FOOT NOTES\n\nFootnotes are reference citations that appear at the bottom of the same page that has the note\nnumber in superscript. Endnotes are also reference citations except that they're all gathered\ntogether at the end of the essay or book.\nHOW TO USE ENDNOTES\n\n1: Type a sentence and if you need to cite, you will click endnotes under the footnotes tab.\n\nAn example would be:\n\n29\n\n\fWord 2013 Advanced\n\nHOW TO USE FOOTNOTES\n\n1: Use footnotes when you reference something using words or terms that people aren\u2019t\nfamiliar with. You will go to the references tab and click insert footnotes.\n\n30\n\n\fWord 2013 Advanced\n\nHowever, unlike the endnotes that could\nshow up anywhere on the page (where\nsentences or paragraphs end), the\nfootnote will ALWAYS show at the end\nof the page. For example:\n\nFootnote.\n\n31\n\n\fWord 2013 Advanced\n\nThis is a better example of just maybe\nwhat an endnote could look like. On the\nnext page will be a bigger example of\nfootnotes. Can you see how different they\nare?\n\n32\n\n\fWord 2013 Advanced\n\nAs you can see from this example,\nfootnotes always appear at the bottom.\n33\n\n\fWord 2013 Advanced\nCAPTIONS\n\nAlmost like the textboxes, captions are used to label a picture, chart or whatever\nelse you will need to label. However, unlike textboxes, it will only be labeled as\n\u201cfigure,\u201d \u201ctable,\u201d or \u201cequation\u201d like in the example below:\n\nFigure 1: The Pyramid in Cairo\n\n1: Go to the Captions tab and click the icon with the document with a picture on it.\n\n34\n\n\fWord 2013 Advanced\n\n2: You will be brought to a dialogue box\nand will be given options of figure, table\nor equation. Pick whatever suits your\nneeds best.\n\nHere you will be able to choose either the\nequation, figure or table label.\n\nHere you will also be able to choose\nwhether you want numbers, roman numerals or letters following the label.\n\nClick the numbering\u2026\nbutton for your options.\n\nHere are the lists of options\nthat are available for you\nto use.\n\n35\n\n\fWord 2013 Advanced\nCROSS REFERENCES\n\nCross references are for large documents and refer to items such as headings,\nfigures, and tables by inserting a cross reference such as \u201cSee Table 6 below\u201d or\n\u201cTurn to page 8.\u201d Cross references are automatically updated if the content is moved\nto another location. By default, cross references are inserted as hyperlinks.\nFor inserting cross references in Word 2013, make sure every picture is captioned because\ncross referencing only works on inserting headings, bookmarks, captions in your document. As\na heads up, if you have created footnotes, endnotes, headings and page numbers, you will NOT\nbe able to cross reference them.\n1: In the document you just put captions in, you will be able to cross-reference. If you did not\ncaption and have no plans to (or will be captioning later, which I suggest opening NOW to\ncaption before cross referencing), please open up the document that you wish to cros\nreference.\n2: Go to the Caption tab and you will see \u201cCross Reference\u201d as the last option.\n\nClick the cross reference and you will be brought to the following screen.\n\n36\n\n\fWord 2013 Advanced\n\nAs you can see, there are\nmany options; choose\nwhich one suits best for\nyou.\n\n37\n\n\fWord 2013 Advanced\n\n3: When you make your\nselection of either\nNumbered item, Heading,\nBookmark, Footnote,\nEndnote, Equation,\nBookmark, and Figure, be\nsure to click hyperlink and\nclick insert.\n\nI inserted this as \u201cabove/below\u201d\nand inserted the hyperlink below\nthe end of the paragraph. The\nlink is highlighted in gray.\n\nINDEXING\n\nIndexes, in my opinion, are very useful and helpful not only for the writers, but for\nthe readers as well. If you are writing a book, a report, or whatever, the index is a list\nof keywords found in the document along with the page number they\u2019re found on.\nThis can be used for Table of Contents as well.\n1: Open the document you would like to index. The example I will use is of a finished\nmanuscript and the author wants to index it before sending off to the editor and publisher.\n2: Locate the Index tab, and then click mark entry.\n\n38\n\n\fWord 2013 Advanced\n\nOnce you click mark entry, you will be taken to\nthe following screen\n\nDepending on the style\nyou want, you can make\nthe page numbers bold\nand/or italic.\n\n39\n\n\fWord 2013 Advanced\nStep 2: Select the phrase you want for the Main entry (as marked above in red). For this\nexample I am going to mark the Main entry as the poem For Clay.\n\nThe text you selected is defaulted into the MAIN ENTRY and it is this text that appears in the\nindex. If you want some other text to appear, then just type that into the MAIN ENTRY. If you\nwant to apply a more specific sub entry, type that into the Subentry box. For example, a\ndocument on CATS entry could have SIAMESE and RAGDOLL subentries.

And although that\ndependency keeps growing each day, the human right to education and\ninformation is not extended to the IT area. Problems appeared that affect society\nas a whole, creating gaps and distancing people from the main reason and\nmotivation for advancement, from opportunities. Being a computer illiterate\nperson today means being a person who is unable to participate in modern\nsociety, a person without opportunities. Despite the recognition from the\nEuropean Commission, UNESCO, OECD and other relevant institutions about the\nnecessity and usefulness of computer literacy, there are still groups of people with\ndifficult access to basic computer education (e.g., persons with disabilities, people\nwith learning disabilities, migrant workers, the unemployed, people living in\nremote places with no access to computer education).\nThis guide, along with other materials published on the ITdesk.info webpage\nrepresents our contribution to the realization and promotion of the human right\nto education and information in the IT field. We hope that this education will help\nyou in mastering basic computer skills and we wish you to learn as much, thus\nbecoming an active member of modern IT society.\nSincerely yours,\nITdesk.info team\n\nITdesk.info is licensed under a Creative Commons AttributionNoncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0 Croatia License\n\n0/49\n\n\fITdesk.info \u2013 project of computer e-education with open access\n\nCONTENT\nIntroduction ...........................................................................................................................0\n1.
